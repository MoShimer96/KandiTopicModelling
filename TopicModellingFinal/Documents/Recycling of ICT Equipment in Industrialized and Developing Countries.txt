Recycling of ICT Equipment
in Industrialized and Developing
Countries
Heinz Böni, Mathias Schluep and Rolf Widmer

Abstract The increasing penetration of society with Information and Communication
Technologies (ICT) is resulting in growing waste volumes. Typical of this waste is
the combination of its intrinsic value due to the high content of basic and precious
metals with health and environmental hazards caused by the occurrence of toxic
substances in combination with inadequate recycling practices. Based on the
principle of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), industrialized countries
have legislated WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) management.
As a consequence, producers established take-back schemes. In developing
countries, the absence of a legal framework and formal recycling infrastructure as
well as the presence of the self-organized informal sector has complicated similar
efforts. In some countries, progress could be achieved through the promulgation of
a legal framework and the establishment of basic recycling infrastructure. The
environmental and social aspects associated with the improper recycling of WEEE
and the sustainable reintegration of secondary resources demands strong efforts
from industry, government, and civil society.

1 Introduction
The use of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) has grown rapidly in recent
decades. Expanded functionalities and decreasing prices have influenced consumer
behavior. The trend toward embedding Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into different goods used daily has widened the range of EEE. As a
consequence, Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) has become the
fastest-growing waste stream worldwide [1].
This is particularly the case for ICT equipment, where sales of new technologies have outperformed growth in other sectors [2]. In industrialized countries, this
phenomenon could be observed as early as the 1990’s, while developing countries
have been lagging behind. In recent years, however, growth rates of ICT sales in
developing countries have exceeded the corresponding rates in industrialized
countries. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the
number of mobile-phone subscriptions in industrialized countries grew by 14 %
from 2009 to 2013, whereas growth in developing countries reached 48 % during
the same period [3]. Similar trends can be observed for computer penetration in
households or for per capita use of the Internet.
The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of
Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal [4] regulates among others the export of ICT
waste to non-OECD countries. However, this international treaty could not prevent
such exports since not all countries have ratified it, among others the United States
as the largest generator of ICT waste worldwide. Furthermore, illegal exports are
difficult to detect.
Media reporting on environmental and social conditions witnessed in recycling
activities in developing countries has startled the public and led to calls for stricter
control and regulation of EEE exports from OECD countries. A working group of
the Basel Convention has drafted technical guidelines with the aim of providing
clarity on the distinction between EEE and WEEE in order to better prevent their
illegal shipment. The guidelines are based on a mandatory functionality test which
is to be performed for all equipment designated for export. A similar requirement
has been formulated in the recast of the European WEEE Directive [5].

2 ICT Waste: Volumes and Composition
2.1 WEEE and ICT Waste
According to the European WEEE Directive [5], WEEE is grouped into the following ten categories:
1. Large household appliances
2. Small household appliances
3. IT and telecommunications equipment

Consumer equipment and photovoltaic panels
Lighting equipment
Electrical and electronic tools
Toys, leisure, and sports equipment
Medical devices
Monitoring and control instruments
Automatic dispensers

The category ‘‘IT and telecommunications equipment,’’ mostly also referred to as
‘‘ICT,’’ includes end-of-life equipment such as computers, printers, and scanners
as well as mobile and fixed communication devices.

2.2 Volumes of ICT Waste
Usage of ICT products in a society and the corresponding stocks and flows are
important elements for the design of management systems, both from a waste and
from a material management perspective. Quantitative models for predicting
WEEE flows incorporating technological substitution and multiple-unit product
stewardship have been tested and validated, for instance for the case of cathode ray
tube (CRT) TVs being crowded out by flat screen TV sets in Switzerland [6].
Industrialized Countries. Recent statistics estimate the worldwide quantity of
EEE put on the market in 2012 at roughly 65 million tons and the corresponding
generation of WEEE at almost 49 million tons [7].
In Europe, the share of ICT equipment in relation to total EEE equipment put
on the market ranges between 9 % (Norway) and 23 % (Belgium), whereas the
share of ICT waste collected in relation to WEEE collected varies between 13 %
and 35 % (Table 1). ICT waste collected per capita varies between 0.3 kg/year and
3.5 kg/year (Table 2).
Developing Countries. Due to limited data availability, the quantification of
WEEE volumes in developing countries is an iterative process, often based on a
combined top-down and bottom-up approach. Figures on imports of EEE equipment can often be derived from statistical data, while consumer stocks and disposal volumes need to be assessed through surveys. Informal waste collection is
least documented, for which reason WEEE quantities are often assessed by
assigning lifetimes to specific products. Through additional field investigations as
well as interviews, meetings, and workshops with stakeholders, valuable information such as transfer coefficients between processes, downstream processes of
materials, and information about material quality can be obtained.
Various WEEE assessments performed between 2005 and 2012 have revealed
figures on Personal Computer (PC) imports and PC waste as shown in Table 3.
The data on PC waste are indicative and are derived from material flow
assessments.

2.3 Composition of ICT Waste
The perception of WEEE has developed over the years from a waste problem
which can cause environmental damage and health issues to an opportunity:
ICT components, for example, contain a variety of metals for which recovery is
economically attractive (Table 4). The metal concentrations often exceed the
concentrations found in natural ores [8]. The Kloof gold mine in South Africa, for
instance, has gold concentrations of approx. 6 ppm gold [9], whereas in mobile
phones this concentration can be up to 100 times higher. Similar situations can be
found when comparing Silver and Palladium concentrations in natural ores with
concentrations in ICT components.
Compared to annual production volumes, the demand for metals used in EEE
reaches significant levels (Table 5). This highlights the relevance of WEEE as a
secondary resource. Consequently, inefficient treatment of WEEE may lead to a
systematic loss of secondary materials [1]. Hence, the appropriate handling of
WEEE both prevents environmental and health issues and contributes to more
sustainable use of raw materials.
WEEE also contains toxic and hazardous substances, for example, heavy metals
such as mercury, cadmium, lead, and chromium, or Persistent Organic Pollutants
(POPs), which can be found in plastic casings or in Printed Wiring Boards (PWB)
[10]. Some of these substances have been regulated, and their use has been
restricted for new equipment through the European RoHS1 directive [11]. Other

substances have been banned, but are still allowed for certain applications (for
instance, mercury in energy-saving lamps) or are still present in older equipment.
WEEE and its components may therefore pose a significant health risk not only
due to their primary constituents, but also as a result of improper management of
byproducts either used in the recycling process (such as cyanide for leaching gold)

Recycling of ICT Equipment in Industrialized and Developing Countries

229

or generated by chemical reactions (such as dioxins through the burning of cables).
Due to its properties, WEEE is generally considered to be hazardous waste under
the Basel Convention.

3 Objectives, Challenges, and Approaches
3.1 Objectives and Challenges
The main services a WEEE management system has to deliver are (a) separate and
efficient collection, (b) recovery of secondary resources, and (c) segregation and
safe disposal of hazardous components. Although recycling the valuables contained in WEEE may generate income, other processes such as the removal and
disposal of toxic components as well as system administration, monitoring, and
control to ensure quality may incur expenses.

3.2 Extended Producer Responsibility
Early experiences in industrialized countries showed that municipalities are not
adequately equipped and staffed to handle a complex waste stream such as WEEE.
New approaches had to be considered, and the concept of Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR) [12], where producers resume the end-of-life responsibility
for their products, evolved as a broadly accepted alternative. Based on EPR,
producers initiated take-back schemes, either individually, or collectively as a
group of producers, or as members of national Producer Responsibility Organizations (PRO), to manage financing of WEEE flows and processing steps. National
authorities started to address this concept in their waste regulations.
Formal WEEE management systems adhering to sustainability and extended
producer responsibility principles were established approximately 20 years ago
mainly in Europe [13–15]. The first European WEEE Directive [16] set the global
pace and standard in regulating WEEE management. However, some countries had
started to implement WEEE management policies before the EU WEEE Directive
came into force. One of the earliest legislative frameworks is the Swiss Ordinance
on the Return, Taking Back and Disposal of Electrical and Electronic Equipment
(ORDEE) [17]. Its simple principles of mainly defining stakeholders’ obligations
(see Fig. 1) have led to a consumer-friendly and environmentally sound take-back
system with high collection and material recovery rates [18].
In developing countries and emerging economies, the concept of EPR was not
adapted until recently. Reports from NGOs on the environmental and health issues
related to poor WEEE management as well as various international cooperation
projects addressing those challenges [19] increased the priority of WEEE management among environmental issues requiring special legislative attention.

legislation ORDEE [17]

As a result, WEEE legislation based on EPR has been established in a number
of developing countries in recent years. Summaries of rapid developments can be
found as global overviews [15, 20] or in publications focusing on specific regions:
Africa [21, 22], Asia [23], and Latin America [24]. Since 2011, a few African (i.e.,
Ghana and Kenya) and Latin American countries (i.e., Colombia and Peru) have
introduced EPR as the core principle in their national WEEE legislation. Kenya,
for example, published draft WEEE regulations in 2013 for public consultation.
In Peru, the ‘‘Reglamento de Gestión y Manejo de Residuos Eléctricos y Electrónicos—RAEE’’ introduced EPR as a new principle in national waste legislation
in 2012 [25].

4 Formal Recycling
4.1 Collection
In formal WEEE schemes, municipal collection points and/or retailers’ take-back
obligations are the backbone of collection. In the European Union (EU), take-back
obligations in the previous WEEE directive entailed only municipal collection
points. As in some countries take-back quantities are still rather low, the recast of
the WEEE directive [5] has defined responsibilities for distributors to take back
equivalent equipment they sell on a one-to-one basis (obligation for the customer
to buy equipment with an equivalent function) and free of charge. In addition,
distributors with EEE sales areas larger than 400 m2 have to take back WEEE of

Recycling of ICT Equipment in Industrialized and Developing Countries

231

less than 25 cm external dimension free of charge without the obligation for the
customer to buy a piece of equipment with an equivalent function. In 2010, the
quantities collected in the EU ranged between 1.1 (Romania) and 15.9 kg/capita
(Sweden), with 10 countries still not reaching the required 4.0 kg/capita minimum
collection quantity [26]. From 2016 onward, a minimum collection rate of 45 % of
EEE placed on the market in the three preceding years has to be achieved by each
member state.

4.2 Pre- and End-Processing
Selective treatment of components like printed circuit boards, capacitors, batteries,
mercury containing components and others in most cases requires initial manual
dismantling steps. In countries with low collection quantities and low labor costs,
manual dismantling is a preferred option, since mechanical treatment is not economically viable. In other countries, pretreatment is a combination of manual and
mechanical process steps. Mechanical treatment includes crushing and separation
of different metal- or plastic-rich fractions or mixtures of the two, which then
undergo further segregation steps such as conductivity (eddy-current) or density
separation (swim sink). End treatment of metal fractions is a combination of
different wet-chemical and metallurgical processes with the aim of obtaining pure
fractions that can become secondary commodities. Plastic fractions are separated
into those suitable for material recycling and others that have to be finally disposed
in incineration plants or landfills.

4.3 Health Hazards and Environmental Impacts
Formal recycling processes have the potential to endanger health and the environment. Direct impacts on health are caused by dust in indoor air generated
during dismantling and mechanical treatment processes (e.g., from plastic shredding or treatment of CRT) or nonconformities with occupational health requirements. Indirect impacts on human health may be caused by air pollution related to
incineration processes that are not equipped with adequate gas purification systems
and dust retention.
Mixed plastics fractions from WEEE still contain regulated Brominated Flame
Retardants (BFRs). High average concentrations of BFRs mainly originate from
small household appliances for high temperature applications, CRT monitors, and
consumer equipment, in particular CRT TVs [10].
Primary production of resources, i.e., mining, concentrating, smelting, and
refining, is energy-intensive and hence has a significant carbon dioxide (CO2)
impact. ‘‘Mining’’ of old computers to recover the materials they contain—if done in
an environmentally sound manner—needs only a fraction of this energy input [27].

H. Böni et al.

5 Informal Recycling
5.1 The Informal Sector
In developing countries, waste management is mostly performed by a large urban
workforce, usually referred to as the ‘‘informal sector,’’ making a living by collecting, sorting, recycling, and selling valuable materials recovered from waste
[28]. The marginalized poor account for the majority of the informal sector. They
often include groups from ethnic or religious minorities or rural migrants. Women
and children constitute a significant proportion of the workforce, operating either
illegally or in a legal gray zone and with different levels of organization [29].
Even though informality has been the subject of political and scientific discussions for decades [23], there is no clear definition of the informal sector. Yet all
definitions point toward similar elements and patterns [30] generally described by
the International Labor Organization (ILO) as including all economic units that are
not regulated by the state and all economically active persons who do not receive
social protection through their work [31].
Collection, manual dismantling, open burning to recover metals, and open
dumping of residual fractions are the usual practice in most countries. In smaller
and less developed economies, these activities are usually performed by individuals, as volumes are too small to trigger the informal sector to specialize in WEEE
recycling on a larger scale. Larger economies, especially countries in transition
such as India and China [23, 32, 33], as well as countries subject to intense trade in
second-hand equipment and illegal waste shipments, such as Ghana and Nigeria
[21], display a substantial organized informal sector. The operations of the
informal sector can be grouped into three main stages of the WEEE recycling
chain: collection, pre-processing, and end-processing.

5.2 Collection
In contrast to formalized take-back schemes where consumers (indirectly) pay for
collection and recycling, in developing countries it is usually the waste collectors
who pay consumers for obtaining their obsolete appliances and scrap material [34].
As a result, the informal waste sector is often organized in a network of individuals
and small businesses of collectors, traders, and recyclers, each adding value and
creating jobs at every point in the recycling chain [35]. Since the valuable components of the products collected usually generate an income higher than the price
to be paid to get the product, the informal waste sectors achieves collection rates of
up to 95 % of waste generated [21], which is far above what can be achieved by
today’s formalized take-back schemes [36].

233

5.3 Re-use of Computers
Following a strategy to bridge the digital divide, some developing countries have
taken great efforts to provide computers for schools. Initiatives include the provision of low-cost laptop computers as the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative
or the refurbishment of secondhand computers in industrialized or developing
countries. A comparative evaluation in Colombia based on Material Flow and Life
Cycle Assessment and the application of Multiple Attribute Utility Theory concluded that local refurbishment of secondhand computers is the most favorable
solution since it has relevant job creation potential and extends the use of already
produced computers, whereas the provision of new computers leads to additional
environmental impacts through the manufacturing process [37].

5.4 Pre- and End-Processing
As labor costs are low in developing countries and in countries in transition and
because of the lack of access to know-how and technology, informal and formal
recyclers apply labor-intensive pre-processing technologies such as manual dismantling to separate the heterogeneous materials and components. A comparative
study of pre-processing scenarios revealed that material recovery efficiency
improves with the intensification of manual dismantling [33, 38]. Hence, manual
recycling practices in developing countries do display advantages, such as low
investment costs, creation of jobs, and high material recovery efficiency [1].
Subsequent to manual pre-processing, further ‘‘refining’’ techniques, such as
de-soldering of Printed Wiring Boards (PWB) and subsequent leaching of gold,
silver, and palladium, have been observed especially in the informal sectors in
India and China [32]. A pilot project in Bangalore, India, demonstrated that
besides being hazardous, informal end-processing or refining practices also have
poor recovery efficiency. Improper sorting of printed wiring boards and subsequent
wet chemical leaching processes for the recovery of gold, for example, revealed a
combined yield of only 25 % [39, 40]. In contrast, today’s state-of-the-art integrated smelters, as used in most formalized recycling systems, achieve gold
recovery efficiencies as high as 95 % [41].

5.5 Health Hazards and Environmental Impacts
Informal WEEE management often fills the void created by the absence of a legal
framework as well as the lack of capacity and resources for a formal waste collection and treatment system.

Fig. 2 Typical recycling processes applied in the informal sector of developing countries (left to
right: de-soldering of printed wiring boards, leaching of copper from printed wiring boards, open
burning of cables) (Pictures: Empa)

Due to their daily contact with garbage, people working in informal waste
management are exposed to various health threats, including injuries, diseases, and
both acute and chronic health effects (Fig. 2). Serious health effects and impacts on
the environment are likely especially for workers processing waste streams containing hazardous substances, such as WEEE [32, 42]. Emissions stem from (i)
hazardous substances which are constituents of the waste, (ii) auxiliary substances
used in recycling techniques, and (iii) byproducts formed by the transformation of
primary constituents. The activities of WEEE recycling in the informal sector
involve sorting as well as separation with the final aim of extracting valuable
materials such as copper, gold, silver, and other base and precious metals. The
processes applied in the exploitation of metals are of particular concern since they

Recycling of ICT Equipment in Industrialized and Developing Countries

235

cause a variety of health and environmental hazards. A literature review concerning
emissions caused by informal recycling activities has shown high concentrations of
lead, Polibrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), dioxins, and furans in all environmental pathways (soil, air, water, bottom ash, and river sediments) [32].
Practices for recovering metals such as copper, iron, and aluminum through
burning of cables containing PVC insulation have been identified as a major source
of dioxin [21]. Dioxin emissions from cable burning, for instance in the greater
Accra region alone, are estimated to correspond to about 0.3 % of total dioxin
emissions in Europe [43]. In China and India, a review of various studies underlined very high levels of dioxin in air, bottom ash, dust, soil, water, and sediments
in informal recycling areas, which sometimes exceeded the reference values
generally observed in urban areas by several orders of magnitude [32].
Recent measurements in Accra also indicate increasing levels of BFRs in breast
milk, which are associated with the informal recycling of WEEE [44].
BFRs contained in mixed plastics from WEEE are substances of concern due to
the existing practices of plastic recycling in developing countries and the potential
risk of cross-contaminating secondary plastics in applications where BFRs are not
required or banned. A recent sampling campaign in the informal plastic recycling
sector in Delhi, India, confirmed that secondary plastic is often contaminated with
BFRs. This indicates that mixing of plastics from WEEE with additive-free
plastics from other waste types does occur [45].

5.6 Socio-Economic Impacts
Based on the UNEP/SETAC Guidelines for Social Life Cycle Assessment of
Products [46], commonly referred to as the S-LCA guidelines, the assessment of
socio-economic impacts in WEEE management follows a stakeholder approach
based on indicators in the three following stakeholder categories: (1) workers, (2)
local communities, and (3) society. Studies in Ghana [47] and Nigeria [48] were
based on the framework of indicators shown in Table 6.
Safety- and health-related impacts were observed in both countries, leading to
direct effects on the workers and the local communities as outlined in the previous
section. As most of the workforce belongs to the informal sector, WEEE recycling
does not feature formalized workers’ participation mechanisms which results in
the lack of worker rights as outlined in Table 6.
In Ghana, child labor was observed for cable-burning activities and for manual
dismantling practices such as breaking CRT monitors. Using stones, hammers,
heavy metal rods, and chisels to recover copper, steel, and plastic casings from
CRT often results in the workers inhaling hazardous cadmium dust and other
pollutants [47, 48].
Income levels vary depending on the profit which can be generated by selling
the obsolete equipment to recyclers in relation to the price paid for acquiring the
equipment. In Ghana, a collector can earn 70–140 USD per month, whereas

recyclers can earn 175–285 USD a month. In Nigeria, the corresponding figures
are 67–100 USD per month for collectors and recyclers. However, these figures are
based on calculated incomes based on business profits and do not consider indirect
costs and externalities.
In Pakistan, children 6–18 years old search for valuable materials in potentially
toxic ash. They work in all stages of the chain, from collecting and dismantling
equipment to burning wires and motherboards, separating metals, melting solders,
and acid processes [49].
The International Labor Organization (ILO) states that the existing ILO conventions are intended to address the particular situation of WEEE management in
the informal sector. A code of practice should cover, among other things, occupational health measures, best practices, formalization of the informal sector, and
the formation of cooperatives [29].

6 Trends and Outlook
Rapid innovation cycles and growing volumes of cheap EEE have brought about
steep increases in the quantities of WEEE. Technological advances include the
switchover to digital-only television in Europe, North America, and other industrialized regions of the world, which will accelerate the disposal of obsolete
devices and stimulate trade in used EEE with developing nations. In addition, the
material composition of EEE is tending to become more complex and the raw
material supply more critical. Technologies to recover them from WEEE streams
are needed, but increasingly complex and expensive. In addition, the past and
current use of hazardous substances in EEE will shape WEEE management systems for a long time to come.

It is encouraging that legislation for sustainable WEEE management is rapidly
being adopted in many countries. However, with the implementation and
enforcement of new regulations still ahead, the main challenges are yet to be faced,
especially in developing and transition countries. It will be key to ensure a level
playing field for all actors in order to make cannibalizing of WEEE solely for
valuables impossible and to avoid harmful practices in WEEE recycling. In
addition to existing waste policies and legal frameworks, WEEE-related regulations need to be enforced, likewise posing challenges to coordination between
different regulatory bodies.
Increased Collection Rates and Improved Recycling Yields. Secondary
resources are becoming more and more relevant given the shift of raw materials
into products and the increasing demand for new raw materials. As outlined in this
chapter, collection rates in industrialized countries are still far below their
potential. Besides illegal exports of EEE or WEEE to non-OECD countries, one
reason for this is the lack of access to take-back schemes, which results in consumers storing EEE for longer periods of time and/or disposal of EEE through the
municipal waste stream or scrap dealers. Higher collection rates need to be
achieved in combination with improved recycling rates. In developing countries,
most products enter the recycling chain through the informal sector, which is
characterized by high collection rates. An international division of labor in WEEE
recycling could link geographically distributed treatment options, combining pretreatment at the local level and end-processing in state-of-the art facilities as
outlined in [33].
In the future, the development of WEEE take-back schemes will also need to
address technical and operational aspects of recovery of scarce [50] and critical
metals [51]. The predominant technology in WEEE recycling is mostly oriented
toward the recovery of base and precious metals, whereas scarce metals such as
indium, gallium, germanium, and neodymium are lost in today’s recycling system.
In addition, a comprehensive international approach is required to ensure sustainable recovery of secondary resources. Among other elements, this might
include harmonization of international standards toward fair recovery and trade of
secondary resources and applying international financing mechanisms.
International Standards toward ‘‘Fair’’ Secondary Raw Materials. Developing
countries are suppliers of primary, but in recent years increasingly also of secondary raw materials. On the demand side, consumers in industrial countries are
more and more concerned about production circumstances of imported goods and
wish to have transparent product declarations. While quality, social, and environmental labeling is well established for some renewable commodities [e.g.,
Forest Stewardship Council labeling—(FSC)], it is nearly inexistent for nonrenewable commodities (one of the few examples is XertifiX—‘‘natural stone
without child labor’’) and does not exist at all for non-renewable secondary
commodities (e.g., precious metals from PWB recycling).

Environmental and social issues linked to informal and formal recycling also
cause image problems for producers, usually multinational companies. As
described in this chapter, many informal recycling processes involve low material
recovery efficiency and risk contaminating commodities with hazardous substances. Hence efficient and sustainable recovery as secondary raw materials is a
market opportunity that requires functioning ‘‘reverse supply chains’’ with adequate capabilities for recycling and refining as well as sufficient monitoring of the
quality of the recovered material as well as the environmental and social impacts
of the related processes. Therefore the harmonization of international standards
and the introduction of processes to identify ‘‘fair’’ secondary resources will be
instrumental for leveraging these opportunities.
International Financing Mechanisms. Some of the substances potentially
released by improper WEEE treatment are classified as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), ozone depleting substances (ODS), or greenhouse gases (GHG) and
are regulated under international treaties such as the Stockholm Convention, the
Montreal Protocol, and the Kyoto Protocol. Related to these are emission reduction
schemes and/or international financing mechanisms, such as UN Environmental
Finance Facility programs (e.g. Global Environment Facility—GEF), Cleaner
Development Mechanisms (CDM), and voluntary systems (e.g. Verified Carbon
Standard—VCS), which may be used for financing parts of processing WEEE
properly to capture and destroy POPs and ODS. In addition, recovering secondary
resources from WEEE as an alternative to mining primary resources can lower
GHG emissions and is subject to the Cleaner Development Mechanism. Such
international financing mechanisms might play a crucial role in implementing
sustainable e-waste management systems by supporting initial investments as well
as by creating market incentives to avoid improper processes and to remove
internationally banned chemicals from the secondary resources market.
