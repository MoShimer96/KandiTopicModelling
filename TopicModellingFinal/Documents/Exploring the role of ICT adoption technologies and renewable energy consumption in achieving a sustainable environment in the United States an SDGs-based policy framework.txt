Abstract
In recent decades, rapid development has exacerbated climate challenges, posing serious threats to ecological
sustainability. To address these issues, renewable energy, ICT technologies, financial development, and globalization
have emerged as essential tools for mitigating ecological impacts and fostering green economic growth. These measures align closely with the goals of COP 28, the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the commitment
to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. However, the United States faces considerable challenges in reconciling socioeconomic development with environmental sustainability. This study, therefore, investigates the key drivers of ­CO2
emissions ­(CO2) in the United States using data from 1990Q1 to 2021Q4. The study employs wavelet quantile-onquantile regression along with quantile cointegration to analyze these dynamics across different quantiles and timeframes. The results from the study showed that across all quantiles and periods, ICT adoption technologies and fiscal
decentralization increase ­CO2, while globalization, renewable energy consumption and financial development lessen
­CO2.

Introduction
Over the past several years, the concept of sustainable
development has become a fundamental aspect of global
discussions on how to align socio-economic advancement with environmental conservation. This evolving
discourse has driven the development of major international initiatives, such as the sustainable development
goals (SDGs). These frameworks aim to foster worldwide prosperity by prioritizing sustainable resource use,
clean energy transitions, technological innovations, and
emissions reductions [26, 66]. The SDGs have provided
nations with a well-defined blueprint to address sustainability challenges, focusing on clean energy utilization, advancing technology, reducing carbon footprints,
and enhancing efficient economic practices [9, 16, 21].
Sustainable development now underpins a multitude of
policy agendas, strategic frameworks, and sector-specific
activities across economic blocs and individual countries,
underscoring its vital role in the global pursuit of balanced and resilient development [12, 38, 40, 43].
The United States, a major global economic and environmental player, contributes approximately 25.93% of
the world’s GDP in 20231 and accounted for 15% of global
greenhouse gas emissions, while China represented 29%,2
positioning it as a crucial focus for international carbon
reduction strategies. The slow pace of progress towards
reducing emissions is partly due to the inherent tension
between socio-economic growth and environmental sustainability. As an advanced economy, the United States
faces challenges in balancing economic development
with the need for sustainable environmental practices.
Renewable energy adoption plays a pivotal role in the
country’s strategy to address climate change while maintaining economic growth. The transition from fossil fuels
to renewable energy sources is vital for the economic
and environmental landscape of the United States. However, despite significant strides, reliance on traditional
energy sources still poses challenges to achieving carbon
neutrality.
Several studies have highlighted the environmental
benefits of renewable energy, emphasizing its potential
to significantly reduce emissions while supporting economic growth [1, 3, 6, 7]. However, the slow adoption
rate and the ongoing dependence on carbon-intensive
energy sources create obstacles in achieving sustainability goals. As the US continues to shift towards renewable energy, the challenge lies in enhancing the scale of

clean energy deployment while ensuring economic competitiveness. Achieving this balance is critical to reducing
carbon emissions and aligning with the broader goal of
sustainable development, ultimately helping to mitigate
the impact of climate change both domestically and globally [11, 13, 68].
Another key factor shaping sustainable development
is the adoption of Information and Communication
Technologies (ICT). ICT adoption plays a crucial role
in driving innovation, particularly in green technologies, which are vital for reducing carbon emissions and
promoting sustainable growth [10, 14, 52]. In the United
States, ICT adoption has been instrumental in expanding green energy technologies and improving energy efficiency—both of which are essential for achieving carbon
reduction targets [5, 22, 33, 41]. Despite these advances,
however, significant gaps remain in the integration of
green technologies and the development of sustainable infrastructure. Technologies such as solar, wind, and
hydroelectric power are pivotal in decoupling economic
growth from environmental harm [29, 32, 46].
In alignment with SDGs 7 and 9, which emphasize
affordable and sustainable energy as well as fostering
innovation, ICT serves as a critical tool in the global
fight against climate change [53, 67]. However, the pace
of green technology adoption in the United States has
lagged behind what is necessary to achieve the ambitious
goals set by the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. The reasons for this lag are multifaceted, including limited financial resources, technological disparities, and a short-term
focus on economic gains rather than prioritizing longterm environmental sustainability. Moreover, globalization plays a dual role—while it facilitates the exchange of
green technologies and best practices, it can also contribute to disparities in technological access and adoption,
further complicating efforts to accelerate sustainable progress [4, 10, 14, 15].
Given the challenges posed by rising C
­ O2, this study
seeks to address the gap in understanding how the
United States can leverage renewable energy adoption,
ICT technologies, fiscal decentralization, globalization,
and financial development to accelerate progress towards
carbon neutrality. Particularly, this study explores the
interrelationship between renewable energy consumption, ICT adoption, globalization, fiscal decentralization,
and ­CO2 emissions in the United States. It hypothesizes
that increased investment in renewable energy, the effective use of ICT, well-managed decentralization policies,
and financial development can significantly mitigate ­CO2
without compromising economic growth. By focusing on
SDGs 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13, this study aims to provide actionable insights into how the United States can balance economic development with its ecological responsibilities.

The objective of this study is to investigate how these
variables influence ­CO2 in the United States. The study
contributes to the broader goals of Sustainable Development Goals—SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy),
SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9
(Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and SDG 13 (Climate
Action)—by analyzing these relationships and offering
insights into how the United States can achieve a balance
between economic growth and ecological sustainability.
The study aims to provide information for policy recommendations that promote sustainable development practices, enabling the United States to progress economically
while reducing its environmental impact. The following
three key questions are designed to further define and
guide the objectives of this study:
a. What is the impact of renewable energy consumption and ICT adoption technologies on ­CO2 in the
United States?
b. How do fiscal decentralization, globalization, and
financial development influence ­
CO2 emissions in
the United States?
c. How can the United States balance environmental
sustainability with technological adoption and policy
interventions to achieve SDGs 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13?

Contributions and novelty of the study

This study is centred on the United States, considering its
economic significance, technological advancements, and
pivotal role in global trade and policy development. The
United States possesses vast resources, including fossil
fuels, renewable energy sources, forests, mineral deposits, and extensive arable land for agriculture, which are
crucial for its economic development and its contribution to international agreements and trade. As a major
industrialized nation, the United States is also a leading
contributor to global C
­ O2, which positions it as a key
player in the fight against climate change. The increasing trend of C
­ O2 is a critical challenge, posing a threat
to climate change mitigation and sustainable development goals (SDGs). The United States, as a signatory to
the Paris Agreement, faces significant pressure to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions through effective policy interventions. With the growing importance of renewable
energy and the adoption of ICT technologies, as well
as the effects of globalization, this study explores their
impact on C
­ O2 in the United States. Understanding the
role of renewable energy consumption and ICT in reducing emissions is essential for advancing the nation’s climate goals and achieving sustainable development.
Furthermore, globalization’s influence on emissions

Page 3 of 26

underlines the interconnectedness of economies and the
need for coordinated international efforts to tackle environmental issues. This study aims to contribute to both
theoretical understanding and policymaking by assessing
how renewable energy, technological adoption, and globalization interact with C
­ O2 in the context of the United
States, providing insights for more effective strategies to
address climate and development challenges.
a. In theoretical terms, this investigation enriches
the existing literature on achieving the SDGs in the
United States. It addresses significant gaps in prior
research, particularly the limited simultaneous
assessment of multiple SDGs, which has hindered a
holistic evaluation of progress towards the 2030 targets. This study also offers new evidence concerning research and development expenditure in the
context of six specific SDGs, thereby enhancing our
understanding of their interlinkages. By concurrently
analyzing these five SDGs, the study demonstrates a
level of versatility and breadth that marks a substantial advancement in the academic discourse. This
contribution moves beyond merely reaffirming existing findings, providing novel insights into the roles of
renewable energy consumption, ICT adoption, fiscal
decentralization, and financial development in mitigating ­CO2 in the United States, thereby significantly
advancing the body of economic literature on sustainable development.
b. In practical terms, this study reveals significant policy implications regarding the drivers of C
­ O2 in the
United States. Based on these insights, the study
advocates for targeted measures to mitigate the environmental impact of ICT adoption by investing in
energy-efficient technologies and ensuring that fiscal
decentralization policies include strong environmental standards. In addition, the study emphasizes the
need to enhance investments in renewable energy
and strengthen financial development as a means to
support green growth. Promoting globalization’s role
in technology transfer and green innovations can further contribute to emissions reductions. These strategies are vital for achieving the SDGs, particularly
goals 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13, which emphasize affordable
and clean energy, sustainable economic growth, resilient infrastructure and innovation, sustainable cities
and communities, and climate action on a national
scale.
c. Methodologically, this study makes significant contributions by introducing two novel techniques.
First, the study implements a quantile cointegration
test, which combines the quantile approach of Li
et al. [39] with the widely used bounds testing pro-

Adebayo et al. Environmental Sciences Europe

(2025) 37:20

cedure suggested by Pesaran et al. [48]. Unlike conventional cointegration tests, this method captures
the cointegration relationship between independent
and dependent variables across different quantiles of
the dependent variable, providing a more nuanced
understanding of the long-run relationships at different points of the distribution. Second, the study
introduces an enhanced version of wavelet quantileon-quantile regression (WQQR) that incorporates
p value assessment. This approach is distinct from
the WQQR proposed by Oktay et al. (2024), as it
captures the significance level of the associations
across various quantiles of both dependent and independent variables. By incorporating these advanced
techniques, the study offers a more robust analysis
of the relationships between variables over different quantiles and time horizons. This methodological advancement enables the development of more
refined policy recommendations, providing policymakers with better guidelines for targeted, quantilespecific, and period-sensitive interventions
The subsequent sections are guided as follows: Sect.
"Literature review" summarizes past studies. Sect. "Theoretical underpinning" discusses the data and methods.
Sect. "Data and methods" discusses the results, and Sect.
"Conclusion and policy remarks" concludes the study in
conjunction with policy guidelines.

Literature review
Studies on ICT and ­CO2 have presented mixed findings.
For instance, Añón Higón et al. [17] analyzed data from
116 developing and 26 developed countries between
1995 and 2010, concluding that ICT adoption plays a key
role in reducing C
­ O2. Their findings are corroborated by
Zhang and Liu [69], who, through panel regression analysis, found that ICT adoption significantly decreased ­CO2
in China from 2000 to 2010. Similar conclusions were
drawn by Ben Lahouel et al. [19] and Jahanger et al. [35].
Ben Lahouel et al. [19] employed logistic smooth transition regression on Tunisia’s data from 1970 to 2018, and

Page 4 of 26

their findings align with the idea that ICT can effectively
lower ­CO2. Jahanger et al. [35] reached a similar conclusion using MMQR for top nuclear energy countries from
1990 to 2017, adding support to the argument that ICT
innovations may facilitate environmental improvements,
even in countries with advanced energy sectors.
Contrastingly, Usman et al. [60] found no significant
relationship between ICT adoption and C
­ O2 in nine
selected Asian economies from 1990 to 2018. The ARDL
results suggest that ICT adoption in these regions may
not yet be sufficiently integrated with climate policies
to make a meaningful impact on ­CO2. This discrepancy
raises questions regarding the regional effectiveness of
ICT as a tool for ­CO2 reduction. Shobande and Asongu
[57] also support the argument that ICT can have a negative environmental impact. Their study on Nigeria and
South Africa from 1990 to 2017 found, using the VAR/
VEC Granger causality technique, that ICT adoption significantly increased ­CO2. Table 1 presents summary of
the reviewed papers.
Regarding the association between REC and C
­ O2, studies have been conducted across various countries and
contexts, with the majority of these studies revealing
the positive effect of REC on the environment, though
some studies refute this claim. For instance, Sadiq et al.
[51] investigated the BRICS-1 countries using CS-ARDL
for the period 1990–2020. Their findings indicate that
REC reduces ­CO2, supporting the argument that renewable energy adoption in these rapidly growing economies
helps mitigate environmental degradation. Similarly,
Saba [50] and AlNemer et al. [8] found that REC is
instrumental in reducing ­CO2 in South Africa and Saudi
Arabia, respectively. Saba used an ARDL model for the
period between 1960 and 2019, while AlNemer et al.
[8] employed wavelet coherence analysis for data spanning 1960–2020. These studies collectively highlight
that in diverse contexts—from emerging economies like
BRICS-1 to oil-rich Saudi Arabia—renewable energy can
play a pivotal role in decreasing emissions and improving
ecological quality.
Conversely, Shabbir Alam et al. [54] presented evidence
to the contrary in the case of India, where their BARDL

regression results from 1990Q1 to 2018Q4 suggested that
increased REC is associated with rising C
­ O2. This counterintuitive finding could be attributed to the efficiency
and integration issues in India’s renewable energy sector,
where reliance on biomass and other less efficient forms
of renewable energy may not yet yield substantial carbon
reductions. Hasanov et al. [34] added further complexity to the debate by showing that there is no significant
relationship between REC and ­
CO2 in oil-producing
countries between 1991 and 2019, using an ADL model.
This finding suggests that the high reliance on fossil
fuels in these countries might undermine the effectiveness of renewable energy in curbing ­CO2. On the other
hand, [45] provided evidence from the United Kingdom,
using a quantile approach to data from 1990 to 2021,
which demonstrated that REC significantly reduced C
­ O2.
Table 2 presents a summary of the reviewed papers.
The relationship between financial development (FD)
and ­CO2 has yielded mixed results in the literature. For
instance, Wu et al. [64] analyzed data from Nordic countries between 1980 and 2020 using partial wavelet and
multiple wavelet techniques. Their findings indicate that
FD has a mitigating effect on ­CO2, suggesting that in
these countries, financial growth has been accompanied
by investments in cleaner technologies and sustainable
practices. Contrasting these findings, Wang et al. [61,
62] explored the impact of FD on ­CO2 across 92 countries during the period 2007–2018 using a threshold
value authenticity test. Their results showed that financial development is linked to increased ­CO2, implying
that FD may facilitate energy-intensive activities, leading

to higher emissions, especially in countries without stringent environmental regulations. Similarly, Wang et al.
[63] found that FD increased C
­ O2 in European countries
from 1995 to 2020, as indicated by their augmented mean
group analysis. These findings reflect that, even in developed regions, FD may not always align with sustainability if financial resources are not directed towards green
investments. Ofori et al. [44] offered another perspective
by analyzing BRICS, MINT, and G7 countries using a
pooled OLS-fixed model from 1996 to 2020. Their results
suggest that FD contributes to reducing ­CO2, which is
consistent with the findings for the Nordic countries.
This indicates that the positive effects of FD on environmental quality can be generalized to both developing and
developed economies when there is an emphasis on sustainable financing and investments in green technologies.
Sunday Adebayo et al. [59] used a time-varying (bootstrap) rolling-window technique to examine MINT countries between 1969 and 2019 and found mixed results.
Table 3 presents a summary of the reviewed papers.
The literature investigating the impact of globalization
(GO) on ­CO2 shows a predominantly positive relationship, with globalization tending to reduce emissions.
However, some contrasting findings indicate that the
effects of globalization may not be universally beneficial
and could vary depending on the region, development
stage, and policies in place.
For instance, Chen et al. [23] found that globalization
reduces ­CO2 in 38 developed and developing economies from 1990 to 2019 using panel regression. This
finding is corroborated by Borowiec and Papież [20],

who used the DCCE–MG model to analyse the same
set of countries from 1992 to 2019 and also concluded
that globalization helps to lower emissions. Their
studies collectively imply that the integration of international trade and capital flows facilitates the transfer of green technologies and best practices, thereby
enhancing environmental quality in both advanced
and emerging economies. Similarly, Yameogo et al.
[65] employed the Cup–FM technique to assess the
impact of globalization on ­CO2 in landlocked African countries between 1980 and 2018. Their findings
also indicate a reduction in ­CO2. Fang et al. [30] found
similar results in OECD countries from 1990 to 2019
using panel GMM, emphasizing the effectiveness of
globalization in advanced economies with stringent
environmental regulations and a focus on sustainable
development. Luo and Kamarudin [42] extended the
analysis to G7 and BRIC countries from 1992 to 2020,
employing a quantile regression approach. Their findings indicate that globalization reduces ­CO2 across different quantiles.
However, not all studies align with this optimistic view. Shahbaz et al. [56] found that globalization
increased ­CO2 in 25 developed economies between
1970 and 2014 using the CCEMG and AMG techniques. This finding indicates that globalization, if not
managed effectively, can lead to increased emissions
through intensified economic activities and industrial
growth that rely heavily on fossil fuels. Similarly, Rahman and Alam [49] found that globalization contributes to increasing C
­ O2 in Asian countries from 1960
to 2020 using the PCSE technique. These points to a
potential downside of globalization, where economic
activities facilitated by globalization could lead to environmental degradation, particularly in regions with lax
environmental regulations or where the focus on economic growth overshadows sustainability concerns.
Table 4 presents a summary of the reviewed papers.

In‑depth analysis of existing literature

A review of recent literature on the impact of ICT,
renewable energy consumption, financial development,
fiscal decentralization, and globalization on ­CO2 highlights deficiencies in methodology, variable selection, and
sample scope.
a. Methodological limitations: Many studies investigating the these relationships [19, 49, 53, 60, 65, 69] face
significant methodological limitations. This research
introduces an innovative integration of quantile and
wavelet techniques by proposing the wavelet quantile-on-quantile regression (WQQR) with p values.
Unlike previous studies that have treated quantile
and wavelet methodologies separately, this study
combines them, enabling more precise policy recommendations. In addition, this research addresses the
gap in the literature by introducing quantile cointegration, which allows for the identification of cointegration relationships across different quantiles of the
dependent variable. This approach provides a deeper
understanding of the dynamics at various quantile
levels, supporting more targeted policy interventions.
b. Narrow scope of analysis: One significant limitation
of most previous studies is their narrow scope of
analysis. Many fail to adequately conceptualize and
integrate the relevant variables, particularly regarding the inclusion of ICT and financial development.
Even the few studies that do examine ICT and financial development [53, 60, 63, 69] often fall short of
linking their findings to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically
SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and
SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure).
Furthermore, most existing research tends to focus
on only one or two SDGs, which limits their applicability in the broader context of attaining all SDGs
by 2030. This restricted approach limits our ability to
make comprehensive assessments of overall progress
towards sustainable development, emphasizing the

need for a more integrated analysis that accounts for
multiple interconnected objectives.
c. Bridging the gaps: This study addresses the existing
gaps by adopting a broader analytical framework,
examining the impacts of ICT, renewable energy, fiscal decentralization, financial development, and globalization on ­CO2 in the United States from 1990Q1
to 2021Q4. By employing advanced econometric
techniques, such as wavelet quantile-on-quantile
regression and quantile cointegration, the study provides a nuanced exploration of how these factors
influence ­CO2 across different quantiles. These methodologies effectively account for issues of nonlinearity, non-normality, and stationarity, thereby offering
more robust insights into the dynamic relationships
at play, which are critical for formulating evidencebased environmental policy.
Furthermore, the study bridges the identified gaps by
linking its findings to the achievement of multiple SDGs,
emphasizing its relevance in advancing sustainable development. By introducing wavelet quantile-on-quantile
regression and quantile cointegration, the study provides deeper insights into the impacts of ICT, renewable
energy, fiscal decentralization, financial development,
and globalization on C
­ O2. Based on these findings, the
study recommends targeted policy actions to achieve
specific SDG targets. This comprehensive approach highlights the study’s contribution to advancing the SDG
agenda in the United States.

Theoretical underpinning
The theoretical framework for analysing how these variables impact ­CO2 is grounded in the EKC hypothesis
and the theory of ecological modernization. The EKC
hypothesis posits an inverted U-shaped relationship
between economic development and environmental degradation, suggesting that emissions initially increase with
economic growth but eventually decrease as economies
mature and adopt cleaner technologies [31].
In this context, ICT and financial development can
serve as critical drivers for both economic growth and
environmental improvement. ICT is considered a key
factor in reducing ­CO2 through enhancing energy efficiency, supporting digital technologies, and facilitating
the transition to less carbon-intensive production processes [69]. However, there is also evidence that ICT
expansion can increase emissions due to higher electricity consumption, particularly in regions lacking a
renewable energy infrastructure [38, 40, 60]. Renewable
energy consumption is another significant factor that
influences ­CO2. According to ecological modernization

Page 7 of 26

theory, the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy
sources leads to environmental improvements by
reducing emissions [8, 34, 49]. Renewable energy not
only lowers the carbon intensity of production processes but also mitigates the environmental impact of
energy consumption. However, some studies argue
that the transition to renewable energy can be costly
and may initially lead to increased emissions due to
the infrastructure needed to support renewable energy
generation [18, 47].
Fiscal decentralization, on the other hand, is often
associated with improved environmental quality, as
local governments may be better positioned to implement targeted policies that encourage sustainable
energy use and reduce ­CO2 emissions [25, 36]. However, conflicting evidence suggests that decentralization
could also lead to an uneven distribution of resources
and regulatory discrepancies, potentially increasing
emissions in regions with less stringent policies [28,
49]. Globalization and financial development further
complicate the relationship with ­CO2. Globalization is
theorized to have both positive and negative effects on
environmental quality. On one hand, it can facilitate
the transfer of green technologies and practices across
borders, thereby reducing emissions [20, 23, 30].
On the other hand, increased international trade
and economic activity can lead to greater resource
consumption and emissions, especially in developing
countries that prioritize growth over environmental
protection [42, 56]. Financial development also presents a dual role: it can either enhance the adoption
of environmentally friendly technologies by increasing access to funding [44, 64] or exacerbate emissions
by financing energy-intensive projects (F. [61, 62], p.
92, R. [63]). These mixed findings highlight the complexity of understanding how ICT, renewable energy,
financial development, fiscal decentralization, and globalization interact to shape C
­ O2 emissions, making it
imperative to consider contextual factors, such as policy frameworks, institutional quality, and technological
readiness. Next, we present the hypotheses formulated
based on the above theoretical framework:
H1: Increase in ICT increase United States C
­ O2
emissions
H2: Increase in renewable energy consumption
decrease United States ­CO2 emissions
H3: Higher financial development decrease United
States ­CO2 emissions
H4: Increase in fiscal decentralization increase ­CO2
emissions in the United States.
H5: Increased globalization leads to decrease in ­CO2
in the United States

In this study, we examine how ICT adoption technologies, renewable energy consumption and financial development impact C
­ O2. The role of fiscal decentralisation
and globalisation is also considered. The independent is

period from 1990 to 2021. The study converts the data
from its natural form to a logarithmic scale to stabilize
variance, thus helping to reduce heteroskedasticity and
promote a more normal distribution. To address the challenge of a limited sample size, we transformed the annual
data into quarterly intervals, following the investigations
of [46] and [55]. Consequently, the analysis utilizes data
from 1990Q1 to 2021Q4.
Table 5 presents the descriptive statistics for the variables ­CO2, FD, FID, GO, ICT, and REC. The mean values indicate the central tendency of the data, with ­CO2
having an average of 2.927 and ICT showing the highest mean of 18.811. The standard deviations highlight
the variability, with REC exhibiting the most variability
(0.252) and GO the least (0.048). The skewness values

Page 8 of 26

suggest that most of the variables are negatively skewed,
except for REC, indicating that the majority of their values are concentrated on the higher end. The kurtosis
values indicate that FD has a leptokurtic distribution,
as it exceeds a value of 3, while other variables tend to
be closer to a normal distribution. The Jarque–Bera test
results indicate significant departures from normality for
­CO2, FD, GO, ICT, and REC, as evidenced by p values
less than 0.05. These findings suggest that the data exhibit
a mix of statistical properties, including varying degrees
of skewness and kurtosis, which may impact further analysis using linear techniques.
Empirical methods
Quantile cointegration (QC)

The bounds testing approach by Pesaran et al. [48]
extends the Engle and Granger [27] cointegration methodology to accommodate variables with different orders
of integration, making it suitable for analyzing cointegration relationships, where variables are not necessarily
integrated of the same order. The ARDL bounds test is
defined as follows:
Yt = β0 +

p

i=1

ϑi Yt−i +

q

i=0

δi Xt−i + ϕ1 Yt−1 + ϕ2 Xt−1 + εt

(1)
where yt denotes the first difference of the dependent
variable yt , and β0 stands for constant (intercept). Moreover, ϑi andδi stand for coefficients representing the shortterm dynamics of yt andxt . Furthermore, pandq denote
the lag of yt andxt . Moreover, ϕ1 andϕ2 represent the longrun coefficients between yt andxt . εt represents the error
term.
ARDL bounds test primarily focuses on estimating the
average or mean relationship between variables in a time
series model. This means that it assesses the cointegration relationship based on the average behaviour of the
entire sample, without considering how the relationship

might vary at different points of the distribution. This
study addressed this limitation by merging the quantile
aspect suggested by Li et al. [39]) with the bounds testing
approach suggested by Pesaran et al. [48]. This is known
as “Quantile Cointegration (QC)”. The QC is defined as
follows:

Qτ (�Yt ); = β0,τ +

p


wavelet-transformed quantile of the x at quantile φ. etδ
denotes error term.
In this study, we differentiate our approach from Ozkan
et al. [46] slightly by modifying the WQQR model to
incorporate significant values across all quantiles and
time periods for both dependent and independent vari-

where Qτ (·) denotes the conditional quantile function at
quantile τ and β0,τ stand for intercept quantileτ . Besides,
ϑi,τ andδi,τ stand for quantile-specific coefficients for the
lagged differences of yt andxt , and φ1,τ , andφ2,τ represent
the coefficients of the lagged levels yt andxt at quantile τ .
The error term at quantile τ is denoted by εi,t.
Wavelet quantile‑on‑quantile regression

The quantile-on-quantile regression (QQR) suggested by
Sim and Zhou [58] is an extension of the quantile regression introduced by [37]. The QQR enables the capturing
of the impact of quantiles of x on quantiles of y . Equation 4 disclosed the QQR:


φ
yt = β0 (δ, φ) + β1 δ, φ xi,t − xi +etδ

where yt and xi,t denotes the dependent variable and
independent variable. Moreover, β1 (δ, φ) and β0 (δ, φ) signify slope coefficients and intercept. Furthermore, etδ signifies the error term at quantile δ.
Following the inability of the quantile-on-quantile
regression to capture the relationship across all periods,
Ozkan et al. [46] introduced the wavelet quantile-onquantile regression (WQQR). The WQQR can identify
the effect of independent variable on dependent variable
across all quantiles and time horizons.3 The WQQR is
specified as follows:

Findings and discussion
Pre‑estimation tests results

Table 6 showcases the BDS (Brock, Dechert, and
Scheinkman) test result. In the context of the BDS test
results, the null hypothesis typically posits that the
underlying time series data is linear. The test statistics
indicate a rejection of this null hypothesis at 1% level of
significance. This rejection implies strong evidence that
the relationships between variables—CO2, FD, FID, GO,
ICT, and REC—are nonlinear over the specified dimensions (M2 to M6). Therefore, based on the BDS test
results, the null hypothesis of linearity is rejected, indicating that these variables exhibit significant nonlinear
dynamics that warrant further investigation and modeling using appropriate nonlinear techniques.
Figure 2 shows the results of the QQ plots. The QQ
plot shows the distribution of the sample quantiles for
variables ­(CO2, FD, FID, GO, ICT, REC) against the theoretical quantiles of a normal distribution. The null states
that data follows a normal distribution. Ideally, if the data
follows a normal distribution, the points should align
along the straight diagonal reference line. However, for
most variables here, noticeable deviations from the line

are evident, indicating departures from normality. This
suggests that the distributions of C
­ O2, FD, FID, GO, ICT,
and REC are not perfectly normal, thus refuting the null
hypothesis for all variables due to their deviation from
the straight line.
Based on the BDS test results affirming the series’
nonlinear attributes and the QQ plot results indicating
deviation from a normal distribution, using linear techniques would produce misleading results. Therefore, the
study employed nonlinear techniques to investigate these
dynamics more accurately.
Quantile unit root

Figure 3 shows the quantile augmented Dickey–Fuller
(ADF) test results for the studied variables across different quantiles. The null hypothesis for the QADF test
is that the variable under consideration has a unit root
across all quantiles, implying that it is non-stationary.
The dashed and dotted lines represent critical values at
different significance levels, such as 1%, 5%, or 10%. Suppose the ADF test statistic for a given quantile falls below
the critical value. In that case, we reject the null hypothesis of non-stationarity for that quantile, suggesting that
the variable is stationary. In this plot, we observe that the
test statistics vary across quantiles, with some quantiles
having values below the critical thresholds, indicating
stationarity, while others do not. This suggests that the

Page 11 of 26

stationarity of these variables may be quantile-dependent, implying heterogeneity in the stationarity properties
across different levels of the distribution.
Quantile cointegration

Figure 4 presents quantile cointegration test results for
­CO2 and its drivers, including ICT, REC, FID, FD, and
GO, across different quantiles. The quantile cointegration
test is used to assess whether a long-term equilibrium
relationship exists between C
­ O2 and the explanatory variables at various quantiles of their distributions. The null
hypothesis for the cointegration test is that there is no
cointegration relationship, meaning that the variables do
not move together in the long run across different quantiles. The F-statistic values are plotted against quantiles,
and the dashed lines represent critical values at different
significance levels. When the F-statistic exceeds the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting the
presence of a cointegration relationship for that quantile.
The results show variability in the F-statistics across
quantiles for each panel. In some quantiles, the F-statistic exceeds the critical thresholds (e.g., red, blue, and
green dashed lines), indicating evidence of cointegration
between ­CO2 and ICT (Panel A), C
­ O2 and REC (Panel
B), ­CO2 and FID (Panel C), ­CO2 and FD (Panel D), and
­CO2 and GO (Panel E) for those quantiles. This implies
that the long-term relationship between C
­ O2 and the

and 10%, respectively

explanatory variables may differ depending on the quantile under consideration. Such heterogeneous effects
across quantiles could reflect different dynamics in the
relationship between ­CO2 and these factors, indicating
that a uniform, average-based cointegration approach
may not fully capture the full interactions between the
variables.
Wavelet quantile‑on‑quantile regression result

We then applied wavelet quantile-on-quantile regression,
incorporating p values, to assess the impact of the independent variable on the dependent variable across different quantiles and time periods, emphasizing statistical
significance.
Figure 5 shows the impact of ICT adoption technologies (ICT) on C
­ O2 emissions (­ CO2) in the United States.
In the short-term (Panel A), the impact of ICT adoption
is consistently positive across all quantiles, suggesting
that increased ICT adoption leads to higher ­CO2, regardless of the level of emissions. This indicates that in the
short run, the expansion of ICT infrastructure, energy
consumption related to data centres, and increased use
of electronic devices contribute significantly to rising
emissions. In the medium-term (Panel B), the positive
relationship between ICT and C
­ O2 persists across all
quantiles, implying that ICT’s energy-intensive nature
continues to drive higher emissions despite potential
efficiency gains. Finally, in the long-term (Panel C), the
positive effect is maintained, which may reflect the sustained energy demands associated with the growth of
ICT infrastructure and digital services over time. Our
discoveries are consistent with studies like Shobande and
Asongu [57], which highlight that ICT adoption tends
to increase energy consumption, leading to higher emissions, particularly when the energy supply is reliant on
fossil fuels. Similarly, Usman et al. [60] have also found
that ICT can drive ­CO2 due to increased electricity usage
from expanding ICT activities. However, these results are
in contrast to the findings of Ben Lahouel et al. [19], who
argued that ICT adoption generally reduces C
­ O2 through
efficiency gains and improved energy management. The
positive effect observed in the figure suggests that the
United States may need to implement complementary
policies, such as transitioning towards renewable energy
sources and improving ICT energy efficiency, to mitigate
the emissions resulting from ICT growth.
Figure 6 shows the effect of REC on C
­ O2 across different quantiles and time periods. In the short-term (Panel
A), renewable energy consumption appears to have a
consistently negative impact on ­CO2 across all quantiles,
implying that increased adoption of renewable energy
leads to a reduction in emissions regardless of the initial emissions level. This negative impact is particularly

Page 13 of 26

evident at higher quantiles, suggesting that regions
or sectors with higher ­CO2 benefit more from renewable energy consumption. In the medium-term (Panel
B), the impact remains negative across all quantiles, but
the magnitude decreases slightly compared to the shortterm, indicating a sustained but slightly diminished
effectiveness of renewable energy in reducing emissions,
as other factors might come into play. In the long-term
(Panel C), the negative effect continues, and the relationship remains consistent across different quantiles, suggesting a lasting reduction in ­CO2 with greater renewable
energy adoption. These findings are consistent with studies, such as those by Sadiq et al. [51], which found that
REC significantly reduces C
­ O2 by replacing fossil fuelbased energy sources. Similarly, [45] argue that increased
reliance on renewable energy can lead to a considerable
reduction in ­CO2 due to cleaner production processes.
However, other studies, such as those by AlNemer et al.
[8], suggest that while renewable energy consumption
has a negative impact on emissions, the effect might
not be substantial enough in the short to medium term
to achieve significant reductions, especially if the overall share of renewable energy in the energy mix remains
low. The results in the figure highlight the importance of
expanding renewable energy capacity and infrastructure
in the United States to ensure sustained long-term reductions in ­CO2.
Figure 7 presents the relationship between FID and
­CO2 for the United States. We observed that in the
short-term (Panel A), the impact of FID on C
­ O2 appears
to be generally positive, with higher quantiles showing a stronger positive effect. This suggests that FID,
characterized by increased decision-making power and
expenditure responsibilities at local levels, is associated with higher emissions in the short-term, especially
for regions with higher initial emissions. This may be
due to insufficient environmental regulations at local
levels to implement effective ­CO2 reduction measures.
In the medium-term (Panel B), the positive effect of
FID on ­CO2 intensifies, particularly at higher quantiles,
indicating that the increased autonomy given to local
governments may lead to inefficiencies or inconsistencies in environmental policies, thus hindering efforts to
reduce emissions. In the long-term (Panel C), the impact
remains positive across all quantiles, although it appears
slightly weaker compared to the medium-term. This
trend implies that, despite potential improvements in
fiscal management over time, decentralization without
robust coordination may continue to pose challenges for
­CO2 mitigation. These findings are consistent with the
study by [36] and [25], which suggests that FID can lead
to fragmented policies, making it challenging to achieve
coordinated climate goals.

Figure 8 presents the impact of FD on C
­ O2 in the
United States. In the short-term (Panel A), the effect of
FD on ­CO2 is consistently negative across all quantiles,

implying that an increase in financial development is
associated with a decrease in emissions. The effect is
slightly stronger at lower quantiles, suggesting that FD

Adebayo et al. Environmental Sciences Europe

(2025) 37:20

can effectively promote ecofriendly projects or cleaner
technologies, particularly in regions or sectors with initially lower emissions. In the medium-term (Panel B),
the negative impact of FD on C
­ O2 becomes more pronounced across all quantiles. This indicates that FD
contributes to enhancing the adoption of sustainable
technologies and green financing, which reduces emissions over time. In the long-term (Panel C), the negative interrelationship between FD and ­CO2 is sustained,
although the magnitude of reduction appears slightly
smaller compared to the medium-term. This suggests
that, in the long run, FD remains a crucial driver for
reducing ­CO2 through the promotion of energy-efficient
projects and investments in renewable energy sources.
These findings align with the results of studies by Wu
et al. [64], which argue that FD fosters better access to
funds for green technologies, thus leading to lower emissions. Similarly, Ofori et al. [44] found that FD plays a
significant role in reducing ­CO2 by enabling green investments. However, these results are in contrast to the findings of Wang et al. [63], who argued that FD could lead to
increased emissions due to the financing of energy-intensive industries.
Figure 9 display globalization (GO) on ­CO2 emissions
­(CO2). In the short-term (Panel A), the impact of globalization on C
­ O2 is consistently negative across all quantiles, suggesting that increased globalization leads to a
reduction in emissions. This indicates that, initially, GO
promotes the adoption of cleaner technologies, better
practices, and more efficient production methods, especially in regions with low to moderate ­CO2. The impact
is slightly more significant at lower quantiles, implying
that GO has a more profound effect on reducing emissions in less polluting sectors. In the medium-term
(Panel B), the negative impact becomes stronger, particularly at the higher quantiles, which suggests that GO
continues to encourage cleaner production and the sharing of environmentally friendly technologies across more
emission-intensive sectors. In the long-term (Panel C),
the negative relationship persists, with the magnitude of
reduction slightly increasing compared to the mediumterm. This pattern indicates that globalization can effectively contribute to lowering C
­ O2 over a sustained period
by promoting cross-border technological innovation
and international cooperation on ecological regulations.
These findings align with studies, such as those by [52],
which argue that GO helps reduce ­CO2 through technology diffusion and international cooperation on ecological
standards. Similarly, [2] found that GO can lead to better
environmental outcomes by fostering efficient resource
allocation. On the other hand, the results contrast with
those of Rahman and Alam [49], who argued that GO

Page 18 of 26

could potentially increase emissions due to an increase in
energy-intensive trade and production activities.
Robustness check

In this study, for robustness, we compare the coefficients
of both Wavelet Quantile Regression (WQR) and Average Wavelet Quantile Regression (AWQQR) models. The
blue and red lines represent the WQR and AWQQR coefficients, respectively. Figure 10 compares the slope coefficients from WQR and AWQQR models to evaluate the
impact of ICT on ­CO2 across various quantiles for shortterm (A), medium-term (B), and long-term (C) periods.
The result showed positive impact of ICT on C
­ O2 across
each quantile and periods. The similar trends between
the WQR and AWQQR indicate a consistent effect captured by both models.
Figure 11 shows the impact of REC on ­CO2 emissions
across various quantiles for short-term (A), mediumterm (B), and long-term (C) periods. The trends show a
significant negative impact of REC on C
­ O2, which suggests a similar trend across all quantiles and periods. This
indicates that both models capture a consistent interrelationship, with REC having a generally negative impact on
­CO2 emissions.
Figure 12 presents a comparison between the slope
coefficients of two different models, WQR and AWQQR,
analyzing the impact of FID on C
­ O2 across different
quantiles for short-term (A), medium-term (B), and
long-term (C) periods. The result shows that across all
quantile distribution of C
­ O2, the impact of FID on ­CO2
is positive across all quantiles and periods. This suggests
that the effect of FID on C
­ O2 is heterogeneous, with different intensities at different levels of the distribution.
Figure 13 illustrates the comparison between the slope
coefficients of WQR and AWQQR models for analyzing
the impact of FD on C
­ O2 across different quantiles and
periods. In the short-term (A), medium-term (B), and
long-term (C) and across all quantiles, we observed a
negative impact of FD on C
­ O2 as shown by the coefficient
of both WQR and AWQQR, respectively, showing consistency in trends across quantiles and periods. The similar trends affirm the consistency of the results.
Figure 14 compares the slope coefficients of WQR and
AWQQR models, analyzing the impact of GO on C
­ O2
across different quantiles for short-term (A), mediumterm (B), and long-term (C) periods. The blue and red
lines represent the coefficients of WQR and AWQQR,
respectively, showing how GO influence C
­ O2 across various across quantiles and time periods. The similarity in
trends between the WQR and AWQQR models suggests
that both methods capture a consistent relationship.

Conclusion and policy remarks
Conclusion

In this study, we pioneer an investigation into the
impact of ICT adoption technologies, globalisation,
renewable energy consumption, fiscal decentralisation,
and financial development on ­CO2, considering various
quantiles and periods. Focusing on the United States,
we utilize data spanning from 1990Q1 to 2021Q4. To
capture these complex interrelationships, we introduce
quantile-based estimators, including wavelet quantileon-quantile regression with p values and quantile cointegration. In addition, wavelet quantile regression and
average wavelet quantile-on-quantile regression are
employed as robustness checks to ensure the reliability of our findings. The results from the study showed
that across all quantiles and periods, ICT adoption
technologies and fiscal decentralisation increases ­CO2,
while globalisation, renewable energy consumption
and financial development lessen ­CO2. Findings from

the study provide critical insights into achieving the
objectives of several SDGs, including SDG 7, 8, 9, 11,
and 13. The results suggest that while ICT adoption
technologies and fiscal decentralisation may contribute
to increase ­CO2, globalisation, renewable energy consumption, and financial development play a crucial role
in mitigating these emissions.
Main policy framework in alignment with SDGs

In developing a precise policy framework, the current
study considers various time periods and economic
conditions as detailed below:
First, ICT adoption has been shown to increase ­CO2
across all quantiles and periods, highlighting the need
for complementary policies to mitigate its environmental impact, thereby supporting SDG 13. Governments
should focus on improving energy efficiency in ICT
infrastructure by incentivizing energy-efficient data
centres and promoting the use of low-power devices, in

line with SDG 7. In addition, transitioning to renewable
energy sources for powering ICT infrastructure will
help counteract the increased emissions associated with
ICT growth, contributing to both SDG 7 and SDG 13.
Policies promoting a circular economy, such as enhancing recycling rates of electronic waste and encouraging
manufacturers to adopt eco-friendly production practices, can also help reduce the environmental footprint
of ICT in the long term, supporting SDG 12.
Second, the negative impact of renewable energy
consumption on ­
CO2, particularly in high-emission
sectors, underscores the importance of expanding renewable energy capacity and infrastructure across the United
States. Policymakers should focus on increasing the share
of renewable energy in the energy mix by making substantial investments in solar, wind, and other sustainable
energy sources, in line with SDG 7 and SDG 9. This could
be further supported by policies that encourage innovation in renewable technologies and provide financial
incentives for households and industries to transition to
renewable energy, thereby promoting SDG 9 and SDG

13. In addition, expanding energy storage infrastructure
and integrating renewable energy into the national grid
will help ensure reliability and efficiency in meeting longterm energy demands.
Third, in the short term, globalization has demonstrated a positive impact on emissions reduction, especially in less polluting sectors. Policymakers should
leverage this trend by promoting further integration into
global markets, particularly in sectors that can adopt
cleaner technologies, thus supporting SDG 17. Targeted
incentives, such as subsidies or tax breaks for companies
embracing international standards for clean production,
can accelerate this process. In addition, encouraging
cross-border technology transfer through partnerships
and trade agreements can amplify the positive effects of
globalization on emissions, fostering SDG 9 and SDG 13.
Fourth, fiscal decentralization, however, appears to
be associated with increased ­CO2 across all time periods. To counteract this, a coordinated policy approach
is required to ensure alignment with SDG 13. Federal
and state governments should collaborate to prevent

weakened environmental standards due to local competition for economic growth. This can be achieved by developing a national regulatory framework that mandates
minimum environmental performance standards while
also providing financial support and capacity-building
programs for local governments to effectively enforce
these standards, supporting SDG 16. Integrated regional
planning and monitoring mechanisms could also play a
crucial role in improving local-level accountability and
ensuring sustainable development outcomes, in line with
SDG 11.
Fifth, financial development has a consistently negative impact on C
­ O2, with stronger effects in the medium
term. To sustain this trend, governments should channel financial resources towards green investments, particularly in high-emission sectors or regions, supporting
SDG 8 and SDG 13. This could involve expanding green
finance initiatives, such as providing low-interest loans
for renewable energy projects or issuing green bonds to

fund public infrastructure that promotes environmental sustainability. The development of green investment
funds targeting high-emission industries can also foster significant reductions in C
­ O2, especially when combined with regulatory measures that incentivize banks
and financial institutions to prioritize environmentally
friendly projects, thus advancing SDG 9 and SDG 13.
Tangential policy framework

Following the study of Chen et al. [24], we created a tangential policy framework. While the main policy framework focuses on direct interventions to reduce ­CO2, the
tangential policy framework aims to support these initiatives through broader socio-economic measures. Policymakers should prioritize providing quality education to
the public, emphasizing the importance of clean energy
and sustainability. Educational curriculum reforms that
incorporate knowledge on environmental benefits of
clean energy, energy efficiency, and the circular economy

can help ensure that future generations are equipped
with the necessary understanding to contribute to these
initiatives. Public–private partnerships and communitybased awareness programs should also be established to
promote environmental awareness and encourage citizen
participation in emission reduction activities. By focusing
on quality education and awareness, the United States
can create a foundation for sustainable development that
supports the central policy objectives and aligns with the
SDGs.
Caveat and future pathways

While this investigation employs novel empirical methods and formulate policies aligned with various SDGs,
it is not without limitations. First, this study uses C
­ O2
to capture environmental degradation. Although ­
CO2

is a common metric in academic research, it does not
account for the supply-side aspects of the environment.
Future studies should consider alternative metrics, such
as ecological footprint and load capacity factor for a more
comprehensive evaluation. Second, the policy implications of this study focus primarily on the United States,
limiting their generalizability to other nations. Future
research should extend the analysis to both developing
and developed countries to provide broader insights.
Third, the data used in this study ends in 2021 due to
the lack of available data for certain variables, such as
financial development and fiscal decentralization. Future
studies should aim to extend the time frame as new data
becomes available. Fourth, significant variables like economic growth, climate policy uncertainty, economic policy uncertainty, and human capital were not included in

the current analysis. Future research should incorporate
these factors for a more holistic understanding. Finally,
while the methods used in this study are effective, they
do not account for the time-varying nature of the relationships explored. Future investigations should consider
techniques that address these dynamic aspects.
