Abstract Direct energy consumption of ICT hardware is only ‘‘half the story.’’
In order to get the ‘‘whole story,’’ energy consumption during the entire life cycle has
to be taken into account. This chapter is a first step toward a more comprehensive
picture, showing the ‘‘grey energy’’ (i.e., the overall energy requirements) as well as
the releases (into air, water, and soil) during the entire life cycle of exemplary ICT
hardware devices by applying the life cycle assessment method. The examples
calculated show that a focus on direct energy consumption alone fails to take account
of relevant parts of the total energy consumption of ICT hardware as well as the
relevance of the production phase. As a general tendency, the production phase is
more and more important the smaller (and the more energy-efficient) the devices are.
When in use, a tablet computer is much more energy-efficient than a desktop computer system with its various components, so its production phase has a much greater
relative importance. Accordingly, the impacts due to data transfer when using
Internet services are also increasingly relevant the smaller the end-user device is,
reaching up to more than 90 % of the overall impact when using a tablet computer.

1 Introduction
Direct energy consumption of ICT [1], data centers [2], and the Internet [3, 4] are
described in detail in other chapters in this volume—however, this direct energy
consumption (also called ‘‘end energy’’ in energy statistics) is only ‘‘half the
story.’’ Extraction of the various metals required to produce the different electronic
components necessary in the various devices, e.g., in order to transport an e-mail
from the sender to the addressee, consumes energy as well. The same is true of the
actual production of the various components, for the final assembly of each of the
involved devices, etc. Hence, in order to get the ‘‘whole story,’’ energy consumption during the entire life cycle of such devices and services has to be taken
into account. Such a life-cycle view of (indirect) energy consumption emerged in
the late 1970s [5] and can be assessed today via ‘‘cumulative energy demand’’
(CED) [6], or ‘‘grey energy’’ [7]. The term ‘‘grey energy’’ was coined at the end of
the last century in a study conducted by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, describing a method using cumulative energy demand for ecological
assessment [7]. According to the recent standard 2,032 of the Swiss Association
of Engineers and Architects (sia) [8], ‘‘grey energy’’ is calculated as the sum of
non-renewable energy consumption during the life cycle—i.e., equal to the
non-renewable part of ‘‘cumulative energy demand’’ as defined in standard 4,600
of the Association of the German Engineers (VDI) [6].
However, in order to get a comprehensive picture in terms of the environmental
consequences, i.e., of the sustainability of a product or a service, not only total
energy consumption is relevant, but consumption of (further) material resources as
well as all the releases into the environment (i.e., waste streams, emissions into air
and water) along the entire life cycle also need to be taken into account. This
chapter is a first step toward such a more comprehensive picture. In addition to the
‘‘grey energy’’ along the entire life cycle (i.e., the overall energy requirements), it
also covers the releases (into air, water, and soil) along the entire life cycle. The
topic of (non-energetic) material resources along the life cycle will not be covered
here, but in the chapter by Wäger et al. [9]. The present chapter is structured as
follows: in a first section, various methods and tools for ‘‘grey energy’’ or a more
complete sustainability assessment (in order to take into account releases along the
life cycle) are critically discussed and compared. The most appropriate of these
methods/tools are applied to various examples of ICT hardware components in
view of their ‘‘grey energy,’’ and their releases along the entire life cycle are
assessed in the second part of this chapter.

2 Methods
Since the publication of the Brundtland report [10], which defined the issue of
‘‘sustainability,’’ the scientific community has developed a whole set of different
methods to measure sustainability—i.e., to measure the overall environmental,
social, and economic impacts related to a process and/or service. In 2007, Ness
et al. published their effort to categorize various sustainability assessment methods
[11]. They realized that neither can any of these methods be used in all situations,
nor do these methods take into account the various aspects of sustainability to the
same degree. Their investigation put the focus on three key aspects of such
methods—(i) the temporal aspect (i.e., is the method used to assess existing
products or services, or can the method also be used to look into the future), (ii)
coverage (i.e., is the method suitable for products), and (iii) the degree of integration of the three dimensions of sustainability—i.e., ecological, economic, and
social aspects. Ness et al. allocated these methods to the following umbrellas:
‘‘indicators/indices,’’ ‘‘product-related assessment,’’ and ‘‘integrated assessment.’’
Among these three umbrellas, ‘‘product-related assessment’’ covers methods
focusing on the material and/or energy flows of a product or a service from a life
cycle perspective [11]; i.e., the type of method required to measure the overall
energy consumption of a laptop computer. Methods belonging under this umbrella
include life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC), substance flow
analysis (SFA), process energy analysis, and exergy analysis.
Among them, LCA is considered by Ness et al. as the most established and welldeveloped method in this category [11]. LCA is a method to assess the potential
environmental impacts and resource consumption throughout a product’s life cycle,
i.e., from raw material extraction to waste management, including the production and
use phases [12]. According to Ayres, LCA has its seeds in the 1970s, when for the first
time, a study was conducted in the United States that looked not only at energy, but
also at waste emissions along the various life stages [13]. Roughly in the same period,
initial activities began in Europe as well—motivated by efforts in the area of pollution prevention [14]. During the second part of the 1990s and the beginning of this
century, the method was then standardized by ISO (International Standardization
Organization) as the ISO 14 040 series [12, 15]. The ISO standard distinguishes four
main steps within an LCA study—i.e., goal and scope definition, inventory modeling, impact assessment, and the final interpretation phase [12]. In the first step, the
boundaries of the study are defined—as a study is always established relative to
the objectives that are to be achieved (for a more detailed description see, e.g., [14]).
The second phase is often the most time-consuming part, as the input and output
values of each process within the boundaries have to be collected here—before the
totality of all these material and energy flows is assessed in the third step, based
mainly on ecological criteria. For this assessment, a whole host of different life cycle
impact assessment (LCIA) methods has been developed and is applied nowadays (an
overview can be found, e.g., in [16]). Among the most recent developments is the
method ReCiPe [17], actually an update and advancement of two older, often-used

174

R. Hischier et al.

methods—the CML method [18] and the Eco-Indicator’99 [19]. Applying this
method is a very convenient way of presenting the results on a midpoint1 and an
endpoint2 level at the same time. The large choice of midpoint indicators included in
ReCiPe allows fulfillment of the requirements of the ISO standards [12, 15]—which
prescribe a ‘‘selection of impact categories that reflects a comprehensive set of
environmental issues related to the product system being studied, taking into account
goal and scope.’’
As mentioned above, measuring (indirect) energy consumption emerged at the
end of the 1970s as ‘‘cumulative energy requirements analysis (CERA)’’ [5]. From
the beginning, this measure of ‘‘cumulative energy demand (CED)’’ has actually
been considered the ‘‘most important aggregated result of the inventory used for
comparisons of product-related systems,’’ as stipulated by Klöpffer in an editorial
in the International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment [20]. According to the
research by Huijbregts et al. ‘‘fossil CED correlates well with most impact categories, such as global warming, resource depletion, acidification […]’’; but its use
as a stand-alone indicator for the environmental impact of a product is nevertheless
limited due to ‘‘the large uncertainty in the product-specific fossil CED-based
impact scores’’ resulting from releases and land use due to non-fossil energy
consumption [21]. In this study, the non-renewable part of the CED was calculated
as described in [22] in order to obtain a value for the ‘‘grey energy’’ of the
examined ICT devices. And in order to get ‘‘the whole story,’’ a group of mid- and
endpoint indicators of the ReCiPe method are shown as well that assess the
ecological sustainability of these various ICT devices/services examined here.

3 LCA and ICT: A Short Historical Overview
More than 20 years ago, in a paper entitled ‘‘Applications of Life Cycle Assessment in the Electronics Industry for Product Design and Marketing Claims,’’
Rhodes wrote that LCA ‘‘offers the electronics and power products industry an
opportunity’’ [23]. He concluded that LCA can help this industry sector to identify
the areas for improvement and at the same time determine their potential.
In these more than 20 years, a broad variety of LCA studies dealing with
different ICT devices have been published. In a recent publication comparing
different modeling strategies for modern ICT devices, the author presented an
overview of LCA/LCI studies in the area of modern ICT media devices [24].
Another recent overview is the study by Arushanyan et al. reviewing LCA studies
not only of ICT products, but also of ICT services [25]. Both overviews show that

1
The midpoint level is defined in [17] as being ‘‘at the place where mechanisms common to a
variety of substances come into play’’.
2
The endpoint level is defined in [17] as corresponding ‘‘to areas of protection that form the
basis of decisions in policy and sustainable development’’.

popular ICT devices like television devices or desktop computers are covered by
several studies, while other devices such as smartphones, game consoles, or network components are hardly covered by such studies so far. An important point
raised in both of these review studies is the rapid technological development of the
ICT sector—leading to high variability of the results. In their 2010 study, Andrae
and Andersen compared results from various LCA studies of consumer electronics
devices (desktop and laptop computers, mobile phones, and television devices) in
terms of their consistency [26], focusing on global warming potential results and
primary energy usage. Andrae and Andersen conclude that ‘‘published LCAs for
mobile phone and television sets are consistent, whereas for laptop and desktop
computers, the studies occasionally give conflicting messages’’ [26]. However,
when digging more deeply into these ‘‘conflicting messages,’’ it could be observed
that one of the main points highlighted by the authors is the high release of NF3 in
the LCD production step, as modeled in ecoinvent [27]—an erroneous value that
was corrected by the ecoinvent team in version v2.2 [28], reducing this release by
a factor of almost 1,000 [29] and having a major influence on the laptop computer
as well as all desktop computer systems using LCD screens.
Publications expanding the scope beyond a simple view of end-user technologies (e.g., laptop computers) toward an assessment of the services provided by
such devices, e.g. the use of the Internet (reported, e.g., in [30–33]) have emerged
recently, showing the relevance of end-user devices in comparison to the entire
infrastructure required in order to access Internet data. In a recent conference
contribution dealing with changes of the environmental impacts from ICT over
time, Lunden and Malmodin conclude that although the ‘‘impacts per connected
device and data volume are lower than in the past,’’ further decreases can be
achieved only by reducing energy consumption at core sites, data centers, and in
the end user devices [34].
Today, various LCA databases contain more or less detailed background data for
a variety of different ICT hardware components. Here, the database ecoinvent—in
its version v3.01 [35], allocation-based system model—is used, as ecoinvent is the
only transparent and easily accessible public LCI database currently available.3

4 LCA of ICT Hardware
The origin of today’s desktop computer has to be seen in the IBM personal
computer (PC) model 5,150, commercialized in 1981 [36]—which was for the first
time a system combining a screen, a computer device, and a keyboard in three
different casings. Sales numbers of such systems grew until the mid-2000s, when
laptop computers started to take over more and more market share from desktop

and EIME—but due to the high price of access to these data, they are not considered public

computers [37]. And since the presentation of the first generation of Apple’s iPad,
another class of devices has been taking over ever greater parts of the market in
mobile computer devices: tablet computers [37].
In this section, the first subsection describes an example of each of the three
types of end-user devices mentioned above (i.e., a desktop, a laptop, and a tablet
computer), followed by a subsection dealing with some of the most relevant ICT
components required for the use of today’s Internet services. The third subsection
shows a comparison and combination of all the data presented in the two preceding
subsections. Active use of all shown devices in Germany is assumed for the
calculations.

4.1 End-User Devices
Desktop Computer System. Here, a typical desktop computer system as sold in
the mid-2000s is modeled—assuming that such a system is composed of the actual
computer device, a keyboard, an optical mouse, as well as a 17-inch LCD flat
screen monitor. The inventory data for the computer device, the keyboard, and the
mouse are taken directly from the database ecoinvent [28], while the data for the
LCD monitor were established in the framework of a study for the Swiss visual
communications industry [38], actually representing a 17-inch screen sold around
2010. The resulting inventory data of this entire system are summarized in
Table 1. The environmental impacts due to the production of the devices, as well
as for the whole life cycle—based on an assumed lifespan of 6 years (for all four
components) and 2 h of daily use of such a system, assuming an average European
electricity mix—are summarized in Fig. 1.

depletion potential (ODP), human toxicity potential (HTP), freshwater ecotoxicity potential
(FETP), terrestrial ecotoxicity potential (TETP), and the ReCiPe endpoint indicators damage to

A comparison with published values for desktop computers can be made for the
first two impact categories shown in Fig. 1—‘‘grey energy’’ and GWP, as these are
the only factors that have been systematically reported in the studies published to
date. Teehan and Kandlikar compared these two impact categories in their recent
article, dealing with exactly this topic [39]. One of the models taken into account is
the desktop computer reported in the ecoinvent database [27]; i.e., the model used
here. The authors conclude in their study that ‘‘the weight of evidence strongly
suggests that (…) the use phase is the dominant life cycle phase’’—however, they
take only the bare desktop computer device into account, but no screen. This
makes a direct comparison of the results from [39] with the results here impossible. In the study by Andrae and Andersen [26], entire desktop systems from
various data sources are compared; among them again the system reported in
ecoinvent (however, as stipulated above, based on the erroneous version v2.1 of
the LCD screen). From [26] it became evident that apart from the ecoinvent
dataset, only one further data source reports a system using an LCD flat screen, the
preparatory study for the eco-design requirements of the European Commission
[40]. A comparison of the results from these two studies revealed rather large
differences, especially concerning the production and the EoL phases. In these two
life stages, the (absolute) values from the modeling here (and thus from the model
within the database ecoinvent) are about 3 times higher (‘‘grey energy’’ and GWP);
while the value for the use phase show a similar result. This result for the production phase is even more astonishing, as the composition of the two desktop

computers is rather similar (as shown in Fig. 2 of [39]). From this it could be
concluded that the dataset here—based on the ecoinvent database—represents a
more comprehensive and thus more appropriate picture of this type of device.
Laptop Computer. Developments in recent years at both the economic and the
technological levels in the area of portable computer systems have been enormous;
resulting in a strong propagation of this kind of device, including in private
acquisitions since the mid-2000s.
The basis for this publication is a typical 14/15-inch laptop computer, as sold in
the years 2008–2011, modeled in the framework of a study for the Swiss visual
communications industry [38]. The efforts for the final assembly of this laptop are
extrapolated from the reported efforts for the (older) laptop model in ecoinvent
[27]. The inventory data of the modeled laptop computer are summarized in
Table 2; the resulting environmental impacts (the impacts due to the production of
the device, as well as for the whole life cycle—in this case based on an assumed
lifespan of 4 years, and again on 2 h daily use) are shown in Fig. 2.
Again, the study by Andrae and Andersen [26] is used as a starting point in
order to compare the results from the current study with other studies of laptop
computers. In this study, apart from the original ecoinvent dataset, GWP results for
four further datasets of laptop computers (taken from [40, 43–45]) are reported and
compared to each other. A comparison of these values reported in [26] with the
results of the present study is shown in Fig. 3 (top, left, line ‘‘original’’) over the
entire life cycle of such a device. Actually, the main information in this figure is a
comparison of these studies, based on corrected values, assuming a similar use
phase for all studies. With such corrected values, two of the studies show quite
similar results to the dataset above. As can be seen from the data for the production
and end-of-life phases (i.e., the two graphs on the right side of Fig. 3), the values

Data represent an unweighted average of three laptop computers, reported in [41] and in [42]

reported in the various studies do not vary much. In every case, the study showing
the biggest deviation is the one by PE International; a study for which this
adaptation of the use phase has not been possible due to the qualitative description
of the modeled use phase in [43]. Therefore, as a proxy we assume that for the
original data the models from [40] for office and home use (with 2/3 office, 1/3
home) were used. For the data from Lu et al. no adaptation was possible due to the
high degree of aggregation of the results in the original presentation.
All in all, based on the comparison in Fig. 3, the model of a laptop computer
presented here is a reasonable compromise between all the currently existing models.
Tablet Computer. Another type of end-user device that emerged very rapidly in
the 2000s is the tablet computer—situated between a traditional laptop computer
and a cellular phone [37]. One of the most popular such tablet computers—
Apple’s iPad2 model—has been modeled in various studies (see, e.g., [38, 46]).
A recent comparison of various approaches for modeling this device has shown
that the production phase has a distinctly higher impact in the case of a lab-based
approach [24]. The main reason is the higher density (per m2 of printed wiring
board) of integrated circuits (ICs) in comparison to, e.g., the laptop computer used
in other studies as the basis for the tablet model. The lab-based approach using
inventory data on the level of individual components (i.e., on the level of ICs,
resistors, etc.) results in a more complete, and thus more appropriate model for the
whole device. The inventory data of this lab-based model are summarized in
Table 3. The corresponding environmental impacts (again for the production of
the device, as well as per hour of active use—assuming for this device a lifespan of
2 years, and again with 2 h of daily use) of such a tablet are then shown in Fig. 4.

4.2 Internet (Services) and Data Centers
According to Coroama et al. [3], in addition to the end-user device (e.g., a tablet),
Internet services require four types of devices: (i) the customer premises equipment, CPE (= equipment used by the user for accessing the Internet, e.g., the
ADSL modem and/or WiFi routers), (ii) the access network (i.e., the connection
between CPE and the actual data network, including cables and multiplexing
nodes such as DSLAMs), (iii) the edge and core network with the edge switches
and the large (metro and core) routers for transferring all the data between the
various users and data providers, and lastly (iv) the actual data centers. Table 4
summarizes exemplary components for each of type by showing key technical
information (weight and energy consumption) and the data sources used for the
modeling of these components in the LCA calculation.
Information about the core components (including their energy consumption
and their weight) is only one element necessary in order to calculate the grey
energy and all further environmental impacts due to Internet use. The other necessary element is information about the number of these components in use, their
lifetimes, as well as the actual data capacity per time unit of these devices, finally
allowing an allocation of the impacts per MB of downloaded data. Table 5 summarizes this additional information for the exemplary components taken into
account here.
Estimating the number of Internet servers installed worldwide is challenging,
and different sources report divergent numbers. DCD Intelligence, the research
division of a provider of B2B services for the data center industry, estimates the
power consumption of all data centers in the world at 40 GW in 2013 [52].

Data represent exemplary devices. The energy consumption of the CPE and the access network
takes power usage effectiveness (PUE) into account (as reported in [3])
*In case of the edge and core network, reported energy consumption is multiplied with a factor of
26 in order to take into account overcapacity and redundancy of these devices, as well as the
electricity consumption of the optical transport along this network

Assuming a power consumption of 222 W per volume server and doubling this
number for cooling and other overhead implies around 90 million servers in use
worldwide. We follow Malmodin et al. [53] in assuming that half of these servers
communicate over the Internet, while the other half are used by organizations and
enterprises in closed ‘‘intranet’’ environments. This estimate leads to 45 million
Internet servers. A different approach to estimate the number of Internet servers is
to start from sales numbers. IDC, a market research firm specialized in the IT
market, reports around 8 million servers sold worldwide in 2012 [54]. Assuming a
lifespan of 3–5 years, and considering that some of these servers are not being
used, yields a figure of around 30 million servers in use worldwide. The same
assumption as above then leads to a number of 15 million Internet servers in use.
We use this smaller estimate, because it compares better to a third figure, the
number of worldwide Internet servers reported by the 24 largest companies
owning such devices (based on information reported in [55–57]).4
For all components it is assumed that they are active 24 h a day during the
whole year; even the ADSL modem. This latter is based on the split of 4 h active

4

4.5 million. It seems more plausible that the likes of Google, Amazon and Facebook together
own roughly 1/3 (and not only 1/10) of the Internet servers.

The second column shows the allocated number of devices for using Internet services for the
components (i) to (iii), and an estimate for all servers in data centers worldwide for component
(iv). All these are allocated to corresponding data in column 4 (data capacity as traffic flows per
second in the first three cases, as total annual Internet traffic in the world for the last case), thus
leading to compatible/comparable allocation results

and 20 h idle (i.e., consuming energy, but without active data transfer) time,
reported in a study published in the framework of the European Eco-Design
Directive [58] and used in the chapter dealing with the energy consumption of the
Internet as well [3].
Figure 5 summarizes the resulting impacts per MB of data downloaded, using
these assumptions. When distinguishing merely between the different elements of
the Internet (shown in the top part of Fig. 5), the picture of the environmental
impacts shown here is rather similar, despite some slight variations, i.e., in almost
all cases, about 50 % of the impact is due to the data center and another roughly
40 % to the edge and core network, while the access network together with the
CPE contributes only about 10 % to the impact. The bottom part of Fig. 5 distinguishes between the infrastructure and the energy consumption within each of
these three parts of the Internet. In most impact categories, energy consumption is
responsible for a large majority of the respective environmental impact; only two
of the toxicity categories (HTP and FETP), in which the server infrastructure
causes around 15 % of the overall impact, are slightly different. But in general, the
infrastructure shows a very low impact only with regard to the consumed
electricity.

Fig. 5 Environmental impact per MB of data downloaded—broken down by the various parts
(top) and further distinguishing between infrastructure and energy consumption within each part
(bottom) of the Internet, as in Tables 4 and 5. The same factors as in Fig. 1 are shown (with
AN = CPE and access network, CN = edge and core network, and DC = data center)

4.3 Comparison and Combination
In a first part of this third subsection, the impacts due to one hour of use of the enduser devices described above (i.e., desktop computer, laptop computer, and tablet)
are compared to each other; again assuming that each of these devices is used for
2 h per day. Figure 6 shows the resulting impacts (per hour of use) for the three
devices. As clearly shown in this figure, the picture for all examined impact
assessment factors—including grey energy—is rather similar; i.e., the laptop
computer results in an environmental load that is about 5 times lower than the
desktop computer—and the impact of the tablet, in turn, is lower by a factor of 3 to
4 than that of a laptop computer.
Last but not least, the impact of these three end-user devices is combined with the
data for Internet services, which were detailed in the preceding subsection. Figure 7
shows the results—this time not per hour of use, but per MB of downloaded data.
While the bottom part of Fig. 7 is similar to Fig. 6—simply adding the impact for
downloading 1 MB to the impacts for the life cycle of the three different end-user
devices—the top part of Fig. 7 shows the relative relevance of this download process in comparison to the use of the end-user device (the latter one again over the
complete life-cycle). And this latter part of the figure shows clearly that the more
mobile (and small) the end-user device, the more relevant the impact from the
download process—i.e., while in the case of a desktop computer, the download is
responsible for about 60 % of the overall impact; this same download operation is
responsible for more than 90 % of the overall impact in the case of a tablet.

impact category. The same impact categories are shown as in Fig. 1

5 Conclusion and Outlook
The various figures in Sect. 4 show clearly that a focus on direct energy consumption alone excludes relevant parts of the real (and total) energy consumption of
ICT hardware—especially when taking into account the entire ‘‘data chain’’ (i.e.,
the Internet). Taking into account the entire life cycle of devices such as desktop
computers shows the relevance of the production phase, which becomes more and
more important the smaller (and the more energy-efficient) the devices are.

186

R. Hischier et al.

Correspondingly, when comparing the upper parts of Figs. 1, 2, and 4, it is evident
that the relevance/importance of the use phase drops with the decreasing size of the
device—due to the fact that a tablet computer is much more energy-efficient than a
desktop computer system with its various components. On the other hand, the
relevance of the impacts due to the data transfer in the use phase is more relevant,
the smaller the end-user device. For a tablet computer, the upper part of Fig. 7
shows a contribution of 90 % and more by (the production and the energy consumption of) various components along the whole network, as well as the data
centers.
These results demonstrate at the same time that the technological shift towards
distributing computing with low-power user devices (e.g., tablet computers)
connected to server systems as part of ‘‘the cloud’’ presents a form of burdenshifting away from the manufacturing and the use phase of the end-user device,
and toward the Internet and data centers. The behavior related to the consumption
of distributed services is becoming a major aspect with regard to environmental
impact. Inducing consumer demand by increasing the efficiency of a production or
a consumption process is also known as the rebound effect, an issue further
elaborated in a later chapter [62].
Does the development of modern ICT hardware such as tablet computers and of
novel paradigms such as cloud computing lead to more or less sustainability? In
order to answer this question, a focus on individual devices—as done in this
chapter—is not sufficient. Rather the general behavior of our society related to the
consumption of distributed services is becoming a major aspect for the determination of the environmental impact. Hence, calculating absolute changes of the
impacts due to such a technological shift depends in large parts on individuals’
behavior and their use and handling of ICT hardware, another topic dealt with in a
later chapter of this book [63].
