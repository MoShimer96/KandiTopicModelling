Abstract: The increasing demand for enhanced communication systems, driven by applications such as real-time video streaming, online gaming, critical operations, and Internetof-Things (IoT) services, has necessitated the optimization of cellular networks to meet
evolving requirements while addressing power consumption challenges. In this context,
various initiatives undertaken by industry, academia, and researchers to reduce the power
consumption of cellular network systems are comprehensively reviewed. Particular attention is given to emerging technologies, including Software-Defined Networking (SDN),
Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN), which
are identified as key enablers for reshaping cellular infrastructure. Their collective potential
to enhance energy efficiency while addressing convergence challenges is analyzed, and solutions for sustainable network evolution are proposed. A conceptual architecture based on
SDN, NFV, and C-RAN is presented as an illustrative example of integrating these technologies to achieve significant power savings. The proposed framework outlines an approach
to developing energy-efficient cellular networks, capable of reducing power consumption
by approximately 40 to 50% through the optimal placement of virtual network functions.

1. Introduction
The advancement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has revolutionized and improved communication, leading to an exponential increase in data traffic
and data usage. According to Ericsson’s report, mobile data usage per month per device is
projected to increase significantly across different regions [1]. Considering the Compound
Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), the mobile data traffic per smartphone is expected to grow
annually at an average rate of 17% in North America, 16% in Western Europe, and 15% in
Central and Eastern Europe from 2022 to 2029 [1]. Figure 1 shows the mobile data traffic
per smartphone in GB for the same period.
The growth in data consumption can be attributed to several factors. The increasing
number of smart electronic devices such as smartphones, wearable electronics, and sensors
significantly enhance data creation and use. The worldwide adoption of IoT devices, such
as smart home appliances and industrial sensors, generates considerable data. Nowadays,
cloud services are an integral part of crucial applications and provide benefits such as

users being able to store data, run different applications, and access services in the cloud
environment. These dependencies on cloud infrastructure enhance data consumption. The
roll-out of the 5G cellular networks promises enhanced throughput and low latency that
will support data-intensive activities like High-Definition (HD) video streaming, Virtual
Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR). The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated remote
work and online learning, which boosted data consumption. In summary, the convergence
of technological enhancements, the growth of smart devices, and the changing behavior of
users enhance the exponential growth of data consumption [2–4].

This tremendous growth in data traffic and data usage has compelled the development
of more robust and efficient network infrastructures to support the increasing demand
for data consumption. However, these advancements in telecommunication networks
have also led to a significant increase in energy consumption, Carbon Dioxide (CO2 )
emission, and climate change, posing a serious environmental threat. Telecom service
provider Ericsson is proactively addressing climate change, a pressing global issue, by
leveraging technology to reduce carbon emissions across their service portfolio, including
telecommunication network infrastructure [5]. The ICT industry significantly contributes to
global CO2 emissions, accounting for approximately 2% of total emissions [6]. This includes
the energy consumption of data centers as well as the entire lifecycle of devices, networks,
and infrastructure. The energy demand associated with ICT operations is substantial. Radio
Access Networks (RANs), which form the backbone of cellular communication, play a
crucial role and consume over 60% of the energy used by the entire ICT industry [6]. Figure 2
depicts the power consumption breakdown of various sections within a cellular network.
The RAN of the cellular network consumes 73% of the total power and the rest of the
components (i.e., core, data centers, etc.) consume 27% of the total power [7]. Optimizing
RANs for efficiency is essential to reduce their environmental impact [6]. Therefore, the
need for sustainable and green telecommunication networks is more pressing than ever.

Figure 2. Overview of power consumption in cellular network [7]. The cellular RAN consumes
73% of total power, and the remaining 23% is consumed by the core network, data centers, and
other components.

Wireless communication is growing rapidly and is widely used to fulfill ongoing
demands; however, most network deployment designs have not focused on being energy
efficient to reduce CO2 emissions. That is where green communication comes in. Green
communication, in the context of cellular technology, focuses on establishing environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient practices within cellular networks [8]. It aims to
reduce energy consumption by optimizing cellular network components such as base stations, antennas, and data centers. Techniques include low power modes during idle periods
and enhancing hardware efficiency. Cellular networks are also adopting renewable energy
sources such as solar and wind to power base stations. Along with these, attention is given
to efficient resource allocation, load balancing, and intelligent network management based
on traffic demand. In simple terms, the goal of green communication is to find a balance
in delivering data while using the least amount of energy possible [9–13]. To mitigate
these challenges, emerging paradigms, such as SDN, NFV, and C-RAN, offer evolutionary
potential. These technologies enable dynamic resource management, hardware abstraction,
and centralized processing, which are key enablers for energy-efficient networks.
This paper aims to explore the potential of SDN, NFV, and C-RAN in creating a sustainable and green cellular network. These technologies hold the promise of transforming
the traditional telecom network infrastructure into a more flexible, scalable, and energyefficient one, thereby paving the way toward a green network. In addition, this paper serves
as a comprehensive review of existing approaches and initiatives aimed at achieving energy
efficiency in cellular networks. Figure 3 shows the block diagram of cellular architecture
based on SDN, NFV, and C-RAN. In cellular communication, NFV can be utilized in mobile
core networks for deploying telecommunication functions as virtual functions [14]. C-RAN
can be used in the Baseband Unit (BBU) pool and Remote Radio Unit (RRU) network to
lower the total cost of ownership and improve network performance. SDN can enhance
the data plane, control plane, and application plane for handling data traffic, controlling
network topology and defining requirements, respectively [15].
SDN decouples the control plane from the data plane and provides a centralized
control that enables efficient network management and reduces the network’s energy consumption [16]. On the other hand, NFV virtualizes network functions and runs them as
software in data centers or clouds, leading to reduced network power consumption and deployment cost [17]. C-RAN, a cloud-based architecture for the radio access network, offers
centralized processing, collaborative radio, and real-time cloud infrastructure, resulting in

enhanced spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. Detailed information about SDN, NFV,
and C-RAN is presented in Sections 3, 4, and 5, respectively, in this paper.

2. Related Work and Motivation
This section provides an overview of prior research work related to energy-efficient
cellular networks. Table 1 provides a comparative analysis of key research contributions in
the field of energy-efficient cellular networks. It categorizes various studies based on their
focus areas, including SDN, NFV, C-RAN, and other green communication strategies. This
classification helps highlight existing gaps and supports the argument for integrating SDN,
NFV, and C-RAN to enhance network sustainability.
Chia et al. [18] focused on making off-grid cellular base stations more sustainable
by utilizing renewable energy sources, such as solar power, and energy storage. The size
of solar panels, converters, and batteries was examined based on the macro Long-Term
Evolution (LTE) base station’s daily energy consumption requirements. In this study, an
optimal solar design, energy output, and cost were considered using the HOMER tool [19].
The results demonstrated that this approach guaranteed 100% energy independence and
long-term stability for LTE base stations. Tahsin et al. [20] introduced an optimal energysharing framework as Multi-Objective Linear Programming (MOLP). This framework
primarily targeted two goals: the energy collected at the base station and the load on the

base station in future time slots. Deep Q-learning was used to predict the energy collected
at the base station, and the results were simulated in MATLAB version R2017b. The
obtained results showed that the considered multi-operator energy cooperation surpassed
the current methods in terms of deployment and management cost, performance, and
energy efficiency. Tahsin et al. [21] presented an overview of sustainable and energyefficient cellular base stations. The cellular base station system models and the possibilities

using physical power lines. In this architecture, each LTE base station was equipped with its
own renewable energy source and storage, and access to electricity/energy was shared via
power cables to reduce the load on traditional energy sources. The proposed architecture
was simulated for the LTE cellular system, and the output showed a significant reduction
in the average energy consumption. Similarly, A. Jahid et al. [23] explored the practicality
of using solar power and wind turbines attached to an energy storage system in an LTE
base station located in a remote area of Bangladesh. M. S. Hossain et al. [24] explored
the combination of solar Photovoltaic (PV) and biomass resources to power off-grid LTE
cellular base stations in Bangladesh. A hybrid energy-sharing system was used, and it was
concluded that this approach was cost-effective and energy efficient.

Motivation
The motivation for our research paper stems from the observation that much of the
existing research in the field has predominantly focused on two key areas: the utilization
of renewable energy sources to power base stations and the development of smart grids
through hardware solutions. These approaches focus on changing the energy resources
but do not significantly address curtailing energy consumption in cellular communication.
Some authors have also explored technologies such as mMIMO, mmWave, HetNet, and
dynamic base station management strategies based on traffic patterns. While these areas
have seen significant attention, we noted that the potential of technologies like C-RAN,
SDN, and NFV remains underexplored in the context of cellular network sustainability.
Although a few papers have introduced the fundamentals of C-RAN, SDN, and NFV,
there is a notable gap in fully harnessing their capabilities within the broader cellular
network architecture. This research gap serves as a source of inspiration for our work. Our
objective is to make these networks more sustainable and energy efficient, leveraging the
full potential of these technologies to address the evolving needs of the telecommunications
industry. The following sections explore these technologies, beginning with the role of SDN
in enabling programmable and energy-efficient networks.

3. What Is SDN?
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an architectural approach to computer networking that enhances flexibility, scalability, and programmability by decoupling the
network’s control plane from the data plane, as illustrated in Figure 4b,c. In traditional networking, both the control and the the data planes are tightly integrated within networking
devices such as switches and routers (Figure 4), limiting the flexibility and programmability
of the network. SDN manages networks through software applications [60,61]. It employs
software controllers, guided by Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), to interact with
the hardware infrastructure and direct the flow of network traffic [62]. This approach offers
a more flexible and efficient method for managing and controlling network operations.
OpenFlow-based transformations (Figure 4b) are executed by the control plane (e.g.,
ONOS or Ryu), which operates under the OpenFlow protocol. These transformations
are supported by OpenFlow-compatible vendors such as HP and Cisco. Additionally, P4

Future Internet 2025, 17, 161

networking devices (Figure 4c) enable programmability in the data plane while maintaining
a similar control plane architecture.

the first generation of SDN where the data plane and control plane are separated and the control
plane is programmable, and (c) shows the second generation of SDN with P4.

An SDN network is distinguished by its agility, effectively combining proactive and
reactive capabilities to swiftly adapt to changing network conditions. Centrally managed
through one or more controllers, SDN provides a unified view of the network, simplifying
management tasks. By enabling programmatic configuration, SDN allows administrators
to define network behavior through software-defined policies, thereby enhancing flexibility
and automation. SDN embraces open standards and vendor neutrality that fosters interoperability and innovation, allowing organizations to seamlessly integrate diverse network
components. These characteristics collectively make SDN networks highly adaptable,
efficient, and suitable for addressing evolving networking challenges.
3.1. Working Principle
Communication between the SDN controller and the data planes is facilitated by the
OpenFlow protocol. This protocol is a standard method for the SDN controller to interact
with networking devices, such as routers and switches, whether they are OpenFlow-based
or use P4Runtime. Through the OpenFlow or P4Runtime protocols, the SDN controller
instructs these network devices on how to handle incoming data packets, make forwarding
decisions, and modify packet headers if necessary. OpenFlow, a crucial component of
SDN, provides centralized control, enabling SDN controllers to manage network devices
and enforce policies efficiently. Its programmability allows administrators to dynamically
define forwarding rules, ensuring that the network can be customized and adapted to meet
evolving requirements. By decoupling the control and data planes, OpenFlow enhances
the network’s flexibility and scalability. Operating on a flow-based forwarding model,
OpenFlow classifies traffic into flows and directs devices on how to process packets. This
contributes to the agility, efficiency, and adaptability of SDN networks [63,64].
3.1.1. OpenFlow
In 2008, the OpenFlow protocol was created by researchers from several universities,
including Stanford, MIT, and Princeton. The goal was to allow researchers to try out new
network protocols on their campus networks. Later, SDN and OpenFlow gained prevalent
academic and industry adoption. Several commercial network switch vendors now integrate the OpenFlow API into their products. Major tech players like Microsoft, Facebook,
Verizon, Google, Yahoo, and Deutsche Telekom have come together in funding the Open
Networking Foundation (ONF) to promote SDN through open standards development [65].

Future Internet 2025, 17, 161

In 2012, Google started using SDN to connect its data centers worldwide because it offered
significant flexibility for managing traffic between data centers.
Figure 5 shows the specification of OpenFlow; from 2009, many specifications belonged
to OpenFlow. From 2009, it was the very first one to be v1.0 using a single flow table and
IPv4. If we look forward, v1.1 has a group table, v1.2 is the IPv6, v1.3 is a meter table (apart
from other things), v1.4 is the synchronized table, and, finally, v1.5 is the egress table [63].

P4Runtime and OpenFlow are used for network programming, but they serve different
purposes and operate at different levels of abstraction. On the one hand, OpenFlow is a
communications protocol that gives access to the forwarding plane of a network switch or
router (or firewall) over the network. It enables network controllers to determine the path
of network packets across a network of switches. While OpenFlow is a protocol that enables
SDN by giving administrators software-based access to the flow control tasks provided by
switches and routers, P4 is a high-level language for programming protocol-independent
packet processors. P4 is a field-specific programming language developed for managing

Future Internet 2025, 17, 161

11 of 39

data packet forwarding planes in network devices in pretty much anything that P4 can
build [68]. Unlike regular languages like C or Python, P4 is specifically made for handling
network data efficiently. It does not support any specific protocols. On the contrary, it
authorizes users to define the required protocols in the program [68]. P4 enables the
flexibility to reconfigure the data plane. It has been gaining increasing attention due to its
alignment with the next-generation SDN standards, characterized by Open Interfaces and
complete data plane programmability. As a result, P4 has witnessed widespread adoption
across academia and industry in recent years [69].
3.2. Architecture of SDN
The architecture of SDN can be divided into three layers, as shown in Figure 7:
•

•

•

Application Layer: This top layer contains all the applications that need to communicate with the network. These applications can include network topology builders,
logging and monitoring tools, network Access Control Lists (ACLs), and other network services [64,70]. The applications are agnostic to the Southbound protocols,
whether they use OpenFlow or P4Runtime.
Control Layer: This central layer houses the SDN controller, which manages the flow
of data traffic in the network devices based on the requirements of the application
layer. The SDN controller uses Northbound APIs to communicate with the application
layer and Southbound APIs to interact with the infrastructure layer [64,70].
Infrastructure Layer: This bottom layer consists of networking devices such as
switches and routers. It is responsible for forwarding packets based on the decisions made by the control layer [64,70].

The architecture of SDN consists of five key elements that collaborate to form a flexible,
programmable, and efficient network. These elements are described below [61,64]:
•

•

•
•

•

•

Applications and Services: These programs and systems use the network to communicate and interact with the SDN controller via the Northbound Interface to request
network services.
Northbound Interface: This communication link between the SDN controller and
the applications allows applications to request network services and receive network
information.
Network Operating System (NOS): The software running on the SDN controller
provides the necessary functionality for managing the network.
SDN Controller: The heart of the SDN architecture, the SDN controller acts as the
network’s “brain”, making packet routing decisions. It interacts with network devices
through the Southbound Interface and communicates with applications via the Northbound Interface. Examples of controllers include ONOS, OpenDaylight, Floodlight,
IRIS, POX, and Ryu [71].
Southbound Interface: This communication link between the SDN controller and
network devices transmits instructions from the controller to the devices and provides
the controller with network state information.
Network Devices: The physical infrastructure, including switches, routers, and other
networking hardware, receives instructions from the SDN controller and forwards or
drops data packets accordingly.

These elements collectively contribute to a flexible, programmable, and centrally
managed network infrastructure. Although there are similarities between SDN and the
Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, it is crucial to recognize that they represent
different paradigms, and their mapping is not exact.

3.3. How SDN Will Help Cellular Network 5G and Beyond
SDN is anticipated to be a key player in the evolution and operation of 5G networks
and beyond. SDN, in conjunction with 5G, will revolutionize network capabilities, offering
significant opportunities for network operation, which allows for dynamic allocation of
network resources, thereby improving network efficiency and flexibility [73]. Integrating
SDN with 5G and beyond networks can enhance AI and automation capabilities, leading
to more efficient network management and operation. Furthermore, SDN can reduce
associated costs by minimizing the need for physical infrastructure and allowing for the
more efficient use of network resources [74]. SDN can also enhance the delivery of networkbased services, IT systems, and applications, improving user experience and enabling new
services. Despite the limitations related to performance and scalability of a centralized
controller approach in SDN for extensive 5G and beyond networks, advancements in SDN
technology are addressing these challenges, making it a promising solution for managing
the complex and large-scale networks of 5G and beyond [75]. SDN can also be integrated
with other technologies like NFV to enhance the capabilities of cellular networks further.
In essence, SDN is seen as an enabling technology that can help realize the huge promises
of a 5G network by providing a flexible, programmable, and centrally managed network
infrastructure [76].
Padros-Garzon et al. [77] presented an SDN network in which the OpenFlow data
plane was controlled. Moreover, functions were executed on OF commodity switches within
a logically centralized data center. Additionally, an SDN controller (SDNC) was employed.
A virtualized Serving Gateway (vS-GW) was deployed on top of the Northbound SDN as
an application. However, the Serving Gateway User Plane (S-GW UP) was carried by the
Regional Router (RR). The UP referred to the data path, which was inherently managed
by the data plane. It functioned as the network component responsible for anchoring user
sessions, managing mobility, and providing access to external networks. The architecture
was found to be similar to the one proposed by Ameigeiras et al. [78]. Furthermore, the
approach closely resembled the work of Guerzoni et al. [79], in which an SDN control plane
was used to manage OpenFlow devices, primarily in the core network rather than in the
access network. Yao et al. [45] proposed the management of OpenFlow switches by the
SDN control plane; however, their approach was implemented within the core network.

Future Internet 2025, 17, 161

B. Allen et al. [80] proposed a method to connect trains and data centers using SDN
and cellular technology. A general controller was placed on the train (local), while an
external controller (data center) was suggested for additional functionality via REST API,
as shown in Figure 8. Silva et al. [81] also investigated seamless handover in vehicular
networks. Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) frequently experience interruptions,
and SDN integration was expected to mitigate this issue. Two different SDN architectures
were proposed, and it was observed that the one with lower complexity provided better
performance in terms of delay reduction, packet loss mitigation, and minimized network
overhead. Additionally, for P4 (Figure 4c), a local controller was suggested for handling
reactive forwarding, while the remaining functionalities (such as telemetry) were managed
at the data center.

3.4. Challenges and Solutions
SDN offers the advantage of easy network programmability and the ability to create
dynamic traffic flow policies. However, this advantage also introduces potential security
vulnerabilities. The overall security of SDN was analyzed by Kreutz et al. [82]. It was concluded that the centralized nature of the controller and the programmability of the network
introduce new threats related to network security, necessitating novel countermeasures. In
SDN architecture, the centralized view of the network has been identified as a potential
security drawback [83]. For instance, a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on a centralized
controller managing a large network of multiple devices would be more destructive than a
targeted attack on an individual router. To mitigate these challenges, several techniques
have been proposed, including replication, diversity, and secure components [84].
Ensuring high-quality services in advanced SDN-enabled cellular networks remains
a challenge. SDN is utilized to create network slicing, enabling support for different
applications. Automated Quality-of-Service (QoS) provisioning per application or service
is required. Automating QoS is particularly crucial when multiple wired and wireless
technologies share the same network slice [85]. A Software-Defined Low Latency (SDLL)
framework based on SDN was proposed by S. Messaoudi et al. [86] to provision QoS and
guarantee ultra-low latency in 5G and beyond networks.
In SDN-enabled cellular networks, effective monitoring of performance metrics for
both physical and virtual networks is essential. To address this challenge, Network Tomography (NT) has been explored as a solution. NT estimates network performance by
analyzing data from a selected subset of network elements rather than requiring measurements from every part of the network. This targeted approach provides a cost-effective and
efficient method for monitoring network health and diagnosing issues [87].

4. What Is NFV?
NFV is a concept brought by network service providers. It is utilized in the core and CRAN of the cellular network [14]. In 2012, a significant evolution occurred when the world’s
seven leading telecom operators, including AT&T, Orange, Deutsche Telekom, and China
Mobile, collaborated to release a white paper based on network function virtualization.
The main objective of this document is to highlight the key advantages and associated
challenges bound to NFV development and deployment. This white paper serves as the
foundation of the NFV concept, underlining its potential to remodel the telecom industry
by virtualizing network functions and abstracting them from dedicated hardware [17].
The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has taken responsibility
for the standardization of NFV and established a group known as the ETSI Industry Specification Group (ISG) for NFV. Since 2012, ETSI has continued to enhance the development
of NFV by releasing significant milestones known as “Releases”. These Releases are issued
approximately every two years. The ETSI Releases are essential for guiding the adoption of
NFV within the telecom industry, promoting interoperability and tackling the challenges
and complexities of virtualization [88].
As we know, every mobile network operator has a significant amount of specialized
equipment and hardware dedicated to performing different network functions. These
functions have dedicated hardware to support their functionality. These specialized middle
boxes are hard to manage, and it is not a scalable solution to expand the network. When new
mobile technologies like 5G and beyond came along, it used to mean a significant amount
of work for operators. They had to change out hardware and redesign their entire network.
Along with these, this dedicated hardware consumes considerable power [17]. Utilizing
the NFV, these network functionalities can be performed in software that is installed in
Virtual Machines (VMs), as shown in Figure 9.

4.1. Working Principle of NFV
The NFV can be defined as a concept in the telecommunication field that aims to
virtualize and abstract network functions, such as load balancing, firewalls, and routers,
from dedicated hardware applications and run them as software on standardized hardware
or in a virtual machine. By utilizing virtualization technology, network operators can
deliver more cost-effective, flexible, and scalable network services. The working principle
of NFV is based on techniques such as virtualization, abstraction, orchestration, and
SDN integration.
NFV uses virtualization technologies, such as hypervisors and containerization, to
develop virtual instances of network functions. NFV also uses an approach defined as an
abstraction to separate or decouple the network functions from the underlying dedicated

Future Internet 2025, 17, 161

15 of 39

hardware. It enables network functions to be implemented as software applications and
makes them more flexible and adaptable. To manage the different Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), NFV requires a Management and Orchestration (MANO) system to install,
configure, and manage the VNFs. NFV mainly works integrated with SDN, where SDN
provides the network control plane and allows the dynamic configuration and management of network resources, while NFV prioritizes the virtualization and deployment of
network functions.
In summary, the working principle of NFV involves the virtualization of network
functions, abstracting them from dedicated hardware and orchestrating their deployment
on standardized hardware platforms. Table 2 represents key differences between the NFV
and SDN and Table 3 shows the differences between NFV and traditional devices.

Network and Storage Resources: NFVI uses virtualized network components
like connectivity, switches, routers, VLANs, and storage (including cloud

(c)

VNF Manager (VNFM): VNFM manages the lifecycle of VNFs, which includes
instantiation, configuration, and termination (on/off) of VNFs. VNF Manager
communicates with NFVO and VNF itself to manage the functionality of VNFs.
Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM): VIM manages the virtual resources
required for VNFs. It identifies, allocates, and handles faults in physical and
virtual resources.

These blocks work together to efficiently control and organize NFV deployments to
ensure reliability and agility in network services.
4.3. How NFV Will Help Cellular Network
The virtualization technique provides the capability to move the network functions
onto virtualized environments, leading to numerous benefits for power consumption
reductions in cellular communication systems. Hardware abstraction helps the operator
to choose more energy-efficient hardware to consolidate network functions into fewer
and more powerful servers. By running multiple virtual network functions on a single
physical server, NFV makes server consolidation easier. Comparatively, this consolidation
improves the utilization of hardware resources and reduces the power consumption of the
network [17]. Based on the workload, NFV dynamically allots resources such as memory
and processing power. This mechanism reduced power consumption, especially during
times of low network activity or changes in the network traffic. Along with these, NFV
also enables the use of low-power processors and hardware optimized for specific network
functions [91].
Figure 11 illustrates the power consumption in traditional network appliances used
for deploying various network functions, as well as in a virtualized system. It has been
shown that virtualization techniques can reduce power consumption by approximately
40 to 50%, depending on the dynamic placement of VNF chains [92]. An architecture for
5G networks that supports NFV was proposed by A. N. Al-Quzweeni et al., and it was
found that virtualization can result in energy savings of up to 38% [93]. Additionally, R.
Mijumbi et al. [94] utilized Bell Lab’s GWATT tool to quantify the energy savings achieved
by implementing NFV technology in different parts of the cellular network. Their findings
indicated that virtualizing the core and RAN can lead to reductions in power consumption
by 22% and 17%, respectively. Furthermore, NFV plays a significant role in deploying edge
computing resources closer to end-users at the network’s periphery. This approach reduces
the need for long-distance data transmission, thereby decreasing the power consumption
associated with data transport.
NFV can also be applied in RAN. With the introduction of C-RAN, computing resources are being deployed closer to user equipment, facilitating the execution of critical
network functions and applications in a virtualized environment. Virtualized RAN leverages NFV principles by distributing virtualized baseband functions across multiple servers,
thereby enhancing network efficiency and flexibility [95].

4.4. Challenges and Solutions
NFV has the potential to provide multiple advantages to the cellular communications
system, but it also has some challenges related to security, performance degradation,
interoperability issues, and vendor lock-in [97].
4.4.1. Core: Challenges and Solutions
Incorporating NFV into the core of cellular networks introduces new attack surfaces
and security vulnerabilities, and these are because of the resource pool based on cloud
computing and open network architecture. This can impact the functionality of NFVs [97].
These vulnerabilities can be handled by developing robust security measures such as
encryption, authentication, access control, and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to safeguard NFV infrastructure and VNFs. Regular security audits and updates are also crucial
to avoid possible risks [98].
The virtualization overhead and resource-sharing in NFV infrastructure may cause
performance degradation, affecting QoS and Quality-of-Experience (QoE) [97]. By leveraging performance optimization techniques such as selecting the specialized hardware
components to upgrade the performance of specific computational tasks, and developing
network function offloading mechanisms, the virtualization overhead could be reduced.
In addition, optimal performance for critical network functions could be maintained by
fine-tuning resource allocation and scheduling algorithms [99].
NFV implies the integration of diverse hardware and software components from
multiple vendors, leading to compatibility challenges and interoperability issues. Along
with this, dependency on specific NFV hardware vendors or proprietary solutions may
result in vendor lock-in, limiting flexibility and hampering innovation. The following
measures could be taken: Set up standardized interfaces and protocols for deploying
the NFV to enhance the interoperability between different hardware components from
different vendors [97]. Vendor lock-in risks could be tackled by embracing open standards
and interoperable solutions. Promote vendor neutrality and flexibility by collaborating with
multiple vendors and leveraging open-source NFV initiatives such as OpenStack [100] and
OPNFV [101]. Ensure NFV ecosystem compatibility by participating in industry forums
and consortia.
Rapid network expansion or sudden traffic fluctuations may affect the scalability.
The scalability could be managed by adapting resource allocation automatically based on

Future Internet 2025, 17, 161

19 of 39

workload demands and network conditions by implementing dynamic resource orchestration and scaling mechanisms [102]. Using cloud-native architectures and containerization
technology, NFV deployments can be made more agile and scalable [103]. To ensure the
successful deployment and operation of virtualized cellular networks, operators must
address these challenges and implement appropriate solutions.
In an NFV network environment, it is crucial to have the same level of reliability
and availability of network services as in a traditional network environment. Figure 12
shows the mechanism to support the reliability and availability of an NFV-based network.
This is achieved through fault prevention, which includes strategies to avoid errors and
operational failures; fault detection, which involves identifying and diagnosing failures;
and resiliency, which ensures service recovery after a failure through redundancy, migration,
and protection of VNFs [104].

4.4.2. RAN: Challenges and Solutions
In a RAN, some critical tasks require swift execution. These include Layer 1 processing
tasks like bit interleaving, modulation, and encoding. Additionally, the scheduling function,
which organizes the order of data packet transmissions and Hybrid Automatic Repeat
Request (HARQ)-related baseband processing are also time-critical. There is a need to
ensure that the total delay plus jitter of the fronthaul does not exceed 3 milliseconds for
HARQ-baseband processing to avoid a loss in air interface throughput [105]. However,
virtualizing functions like these could introduce delays, impacting the QoS and user experience [105]. Two acceleration methods, in-line and look-aside, address these challenges.
In-line acceleration handles Layer 1 tasks before data reaches the main CPU, freeing it for
higher-layer processing. It is efficient and reduces delays. Look-aside acceleration allows
the CPU to handle Layer 1 processing while a separate card manages specific functions,
providing flexibility to offload tasks [106]. Thus, the in-line accelerator will handle one
process at a time, whereas the look-aside accelerator can handle multiple dataflows. On the
other hand, the look-aside accelerator will also use more time for transmission between
accelerator and CPU, whereas the the in-line option is more scalable due to the separation of
accelerator and CPU [107]. Benefits and caveats of the two processing options are examined
in [108].

Future Internet 2025, 17, 161

20 of 39

Both in-line and look-aside accelerations have their advantages and disadvantages,
and the decision depends on the RAN’s requirements and the characteristics of timesensitive tasks. Some RAN vendors, including Nokia, believe in in-line acceleration,
whereas other vendors, including Ericsson, believe in look-aside acceleration [109].

5. What Is C-RAN?
Cloud-RAN is a RAN architecture that centralizes and virtualizes the baseband processing. The RAN architecture widely adopted today is referred to as distributed RAN,
where the Radio Unit (RU) is located in the antenna tower, handling radio functions such
as digital-to-analog conversion and up-conversion; the remaining processing is handled
in the BBU. The BBU is located in a shelter close to the antenna tower and handles both
time-critical and non-time-critical baseband processing. RANs represent a huge amount
of under-utilized resources since the users tend to move around between different areas
during the day. The users will usually be at home in the morning, then they go to work
and come back home again in the evening, leading to much un-utilized capacity, since
the mobile network is critical infrastructure that cannot be switched off when not in use.
Hence, other ways must be found to increase resource utilization and add savings to the
energy bill.
A proposed solution is to move the baseband processing into a centralized data center,
a BBU pool, where virtualized baseband processing can share the same hardware and assign
additional capacity to areas where it is needed when it is needed. Hence, as described in
Table 4, the C-RAN architecture incorporates both concepts of centralized and virtualized
RAN. The concept was first proposed by IBM in 2010. Later, 3GPP evolved for more
agile deployment opportunities [110]. Here, the BBU was divided into a Distributed Unit
(DU), handling the more time-critical functions, and a Centralized Unit (CU), handling
more relaxed inter-site communication. Figure 13 illustrates the evolution of Cloud-RAN
technology, highlighting the transition from distributed RAN to centralized RAN, and
this progression has led to Cloud-RAN, where baseband processing is centralized and
virtualized. Figure 14 illustrates the future mobile network architecture, where radio
processing is divided into three units: RU, DU, and CU [110].

Figure 14. The future mobile network architecture where all radio processing is divided into three
units: Radio Unit (RU), Distributed Unit (DU), and Centralized Unit (CU), as specified by 3GPP [110].

5.1. Working Principle of C-RAN
Centralization is a concept that has been adopted in many sectors to achieve higher
utilization of limited resources, healthcare, for example. But centralization always comes
with a price; the transport. In the case of mobile networks, it is data that needs to be
transported from the RU on the cell site to the DU in a centralized data center. The current
distributed RAN installations use the Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) protocol for
transport between the RU and BBU to encapsulate the very raw signal sent from the RU. The
signal transmitted in the CPRI protocol has only been through a few operations inside the
RU, namely frequency down conversion, sampling, and analog-to-digital conversion [111].
Hence, due to the very raw nature of the signal transmitted between the RU and the DU,
the load is very high and continuously occupies the transport medium, while the latency
requirements are strict [111]. Thus, the distance between RU and DU is bound to the
latency requirements as well as the availability of high-capacity infrastructure. Several
solutions to overcome the huge transport capacity problem of C-RAN exist; for example,
compression [112], high capacity infrastructure like fiber or mmWaves [113], or to add
more functions to the RU [111]. The latter solution is referred to as functional splits, and
multiple approaches exist. The low layer split, separating the RU and DU functions, has
not yet been determined, and multiple approaches exist. On the other hand, the high layer
functional split separating the DU and CU has already been settled, to include the Packet
Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) and Radio Resource Control (RRC/IP) in the CU [110].
When the data finally reach the data center, they will meet a virtualized format of the
baseband processing. Baseband processing functions can be virtualized either as virtual
machines or containers, both enabling multiple virtual software instances to share the same
hardware. The hardware used can be Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) servers, either in a
private enterprise data center or in a public cloud where capacity is rented on demand. In

Future Internet 2025, 17, 161

22 of 39

both cases, using COTS hardware for baseband processing will also make it possible for
other applications to use the same hardware when the load in the mobile network is low.
5.2. Architecture of C-RAN
The C-RAN architecture divides the baseband processing into the DU and CU to
meet more agile deployment opportunities. Hence, a number of functional placement
scenarios exist, taking into account the time-criticalness of particularly the functions in the
DU. The functional placement scenarios vary from having only the RU on the cell site to
having all virtualized baseband processing on the cell site additionally for the benefit of
extreme low-latency scenarios. The Next Generation Mobile Networks Alliance (NGMN)
has defined six functional placement scenarios, where the baseband processing is handled
on either the cell site, aggregation site, or distributed site [114]. These functional placement
scenarios are illustrated in Figure 15.

Figure 15. The six functional placement scenarios proposed by Next Generation Mobile Network [114].
The figure shows the deployment agility of C-RAN, where the deployment can adapt to the current
scenario with more or less functions located on the cell site, for low-latency and low-fronthaul
requirements, but at the cost of less shared processing.

Due to the various functional placement scenarios, deployment of C-RAN becomes
very agile, and the specific deployment can adapt to solve a specific problem in a specific
area. One thing that needs to be considered is the transport network in-between the
fronthaul connecting the RU to the DU and the midhaul connecting the DU to the CU [111].
Hence, when deploying C-RAN, the use of the capacity-demanding fronthaul network
must be determined by the availability or opportunity for deployment of a high-capacity
link between the RU and the DU. Hence, if such a link is not existing or possible to deploy,
the DU, and maybe also the CU, must be left on the cell site.
C-RAN is currently the architecture suggested in specifications by Open Radio Access
Network (O-RAN) and ITU-T [115], IEEE’s Next Generation Fronthaul Interface [116] and
Small Cell Forum [117]. Hence, it is a widely discussed architecture for future mobile
network deployments.
5.3. How Can C-RAN Improve the Sustainability of Cellular Networks?
The initial concept of C-RAN separated the very power-consuming amplifier from the
baseband functions to be installed in the antenna mast. This was done to minimize the loss

Future Internet 2025, 17, 161

23 of 39

provided by the cable connecting the RU to the baseband, greatly reducing the size of the
amplifier and also to be able to benefit from air cooling in the RU. This was the first step
towards centralized processing and led to a huge reduction in energy consumption.
C-RAN will have many smaller contributions to the energy consumption budget.
These will be related to the centralization and virtualization of the network. Hence, C-RAN
will benefit from both. Centralizing the baseband processing will enable improved cell
cooperation, leading to improved spectral efficiency, and thus, there might be small energy
savings to catch due to reduced re-transmissions and lowered interference. Moving all
processing to one location will bypass the need for air conditioning locally on the cell sites,
as it will only be necessary in the data centers. However, this is only for countries with
very warm climates. Virtualizing the baseband processing will enable easier installation
of new power-saving features as well as the opportunity to run network functions on
any hardware, maximizing the utilization of hardware resources, and thus saving energy
from potentially less hardware when the load is consolidated. In C-RAN, the baseband
processing is centralized and virtualized, which will give the additional benefit of utilizing
users’ movement patterns; hence, baseband processing from sites, which users move into
at different times of the day, can share the processing hardware because they utilize the
resources at different times of the day. Furthermore, the agile capacity assignment of
C-RAN will make sure no capacity is wasted because it is assigned to the area where it
is needed. However, it must be noted that, according to the study from NGMN [118],
baseband processing is only responsible for 6% of the RAN energy consumption.
5.4. Challenges and Solutions
The huge drawback of C-RAN is the fronthaul network, connecting the RU to the
DU. Originally, RUs used the CPRI protocol [119] for transport over the fronthaul network.
However, the CPRI protocol induces a constant and very high load on the fronthaul network,
since it is synchronous and scales by the number of antennas. Hence, the solution has
been to add more functions to the RU, known as functional splitting. Various approaches
to functional splits exist, proposed by enhanced Common Public Radio Interface (eCPRI)
[119], small cell forum [117], O-RAN Alliance [120], and 3GPP [110]. The more functions
added to the RU, the more complex the RU and less shared processing in the data center.
Conversely, having fewer functions added to the RU results in higher requirements to the
fronthaul network in terms of capacity and latency. This is illustrated in Figure 16. So far,
the O-RAN alliance and small cell forum are the only organizations focusing on only one
or two functional split options. Small cell forums propose a division of the physical layer
and the MAC layer. Hence, all of the physical layer processing must be handled in the RU,
whereas the Media Access Control (MAC) and the above Radio Link Control (RLC) are
handled in the DU. For the sake of O-RAN, they propose a functional split 7-2x category A
and B, where the difference is that the category B radio unit includes beamforming and is
more suitable for high-traffic areas [120].
In the case of hardware for virtualized RAN functions, there is currently significant
attention being paid to the CPUs handling physical layer processing [109]. This has already
been described in the NFV Section 4.4.2 under Challenges and Solutions. This problem
is also affected by the functional split since it is the physical layer functions that require
heavy processing. Hence, using the PHY/MAC split proposed by the small cell forum will
eliminate the discussion on in-line and look-aside acceleration.

6. Pitfalls and Potentials
The convergence of SDN, NFV, and C-RAN portrays a significant change in the
designing, deploying, and management of telecommunication networks. This convergence
promises to enhance the scalability, flexibility, and efficiency of the network operations.
Along with these, it intends to decrease the Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and OpEx of the
entire telecommunication infrastructure.
However, the convergence of these technologies brings some challenges that need to
be considered for successful implementation. Following are some challenges and potential solutions:
•

•

•

•

Interoperability and Standardization: Different vendors may implement the supporting hardware and software related to SDN, NFV, and C-RAN technologies using their
proprietary protocols and interfaces, resulting in interoperability issues. To avoid the
interoperability issue, there should be a strong collaboration between the different
stakeholders. The telecom industry should promote organizations like ONF [64] and
ETSI [121] that support the standardization of these tools and technologies [122].
Scalability: As telecom networks expand in size to support the increasing demand
for connectivity raises the complexity of the network and leads to scalability issues
related to SDN, NFV, and C-RAN. Dynamic scaling mechanisms can be implemented
to solve the scalability issues. Technologies like orchestration can also be employed to
handle the scalability issue [123].
Network Performance and Latency: Introducing the virtualization and centralization
control of network functions may increase the latency and affect real-time applications,
for instance, voice and video streaming. To mitigate latency issues, SDN- and NFVbased edge computing capabilities can be deployed near the end-users. The use
of efficient routing algorithms and optimization of network architecture can also
minimize latency [124].
Management and Orchestration: It can be challenging to manage and orchestrate
virtualized network functions across distributed environments. Utilizing comprehensive management and orchestration platforms can provide centralized control and

Future Internet 2025, 17, 161

•

•

automation capabilities to ease network operations. These platforms also support
multi-vendor environments [125].
Resource Utilization and Optimization: Amplifying resource utilization in virtualized environments, whether it is computing, storage, or networking, is crucial for
achieving cost-effectiveness. Utilizing intelligent resource allocation algorithms and
analytics-driven optimization techniques can help optimize resource utilization. Furthermore, network-slicing technologies can facilitate efficient resource allocation for
specific applications [126].
Regulatory and Compliance Issues: Ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and standards during the implementation of SDN, NFV, and C-RAN solutions
introduces some challenges due to the dynamic nature of virtualized networks. It is
crucial to be updated with the new rules and regulations set by the regulatory bodies.
It is also important to utilize features such as network segmentation and encryption to
protect data and avoid compliance issues [127].

Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort from industry stakeholders,
including network operators, equipment vendors, standardization bodies, and regulatory
authorities. By overcoming these hurdles, the convergence of SDN, NFV, and C-RAN
has the potential to revolutionize telecommunications networks, enabling greater agility,
efficiency, and innovation.
6.1. Reducing the Energy Consumption
SDN, NFV, and C-RAN can collectively reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint in the cellular communication network. Here are some features of these technologies
that will enhance energy efficiency: SDN provides centralized control of network resources
using a software-based controller. It can manage network resources based on real-time
network traffic demands and optimize network routing, leading to a more efficient way
of using network equipment and reducing the energy needed for data transfer. Using the
SDN, energy-aware routing and scheduling algorithms can be formulated that can reduce
the power consumption of network devices by prudently selecting the most energy-efficient
paths to route the traffic. The SDN-based centralized controller also helps to power down
unnecessary networks during periods of low demand, such as un-utilized base stations
being switched off.
NFV virtualizes multiple network functions and deploys them as software instances
on standard server hardware or the cloud, instead of dedicated physical machines. As
NFV consolidates multiple network functions onto a shared hardware infrastructure, it
reduces energy consumption and carbon footprint by reducing the number of physical
devices required. The 5G network functions, such as Unified Data Management (UDM),
Application Function (AF), Network Repository Function (NRF), and many others, can be
virtualized to enhance the energy efficiency of the communication network. NFV also helps
for the dynamic scaling of network functions to support varying demands by deploying or
decommissioning virtual network functions based on the load on the network. This results
in reductions in capital and operating expenditures, including energy consumption [95].
C-RAN centralizes the baseband processing functions of multiple RRUs in one data
center/cloud/centralized location, and it connects to radio units via high-speed fiber
optic cables. This mechanism allows for harmonized resource allocation and interference
management, reduces the need for physical network infrastructure, and improves energy
efficiency in data transmission and processing. For instance, an investigation [128] has
shown that using C-RAN architecture leads to approximately 83% energy reduction in
the BBUs.

Future Internet 2025, 17, 161

26 of 39

Collectively, SDN, NFV, and C-RAN provide an efficient way to reduce energy consumption in telecommunication networks by offering centralized control, optimizing
resource allocation, reducing the need for physical network infrastructure, and enhancing
energy efficiency in data transmission and processing. Nevertheless, the real impact may
be different depending on practical implementation and usage scenario.
6.2. Virtualization Feasibility of Network Functions
The feasibility of virtualizing network functions is a critical consideration in networking architectures. While some functions seamlessly transition to virtualized environments, others pose significant challenges due to their complexity, real-time requirements,
or resource-intensive nature. Evaluating the virtualization feasibility involves assessing
factors such as latency requirements, resource utilization, and the ability to maintain desired levels of QoS and QoE. By carefully examining these factors, network architects
can determine the viability of virtualizing specific functions and develop strategies to
address challenges encountered during the virtualization process. In this subsection, we
tried to differentiate the network functions of Core and RAN based on the complexity of
virtualizing them.
6.2.1. Core Functions Easy for Virtualization
The UDM manages user data and subscription information such as credentials, user
identification, and access authorization. The UDM works with the Unified Data Repository (UDR), which is a centralized storage in a 5G network for storing user-related data,
network information, and service-related parameters to provide access to various 5G network functions [129,130]. These network functions are basically deployed in a cloud-based
infrastructure, and they could be virtualized [131]. The Authentication Server Function
(AUSF) handles user authentication, security key management, and ensuring secure communication between the network and the user equipment [129,130]. This network function
could be easily virtualized [132].
The AF supports traffic routing and interacts with the policy framework [129,130]. AF
is primarily software-based, which makes it ideal for virtualization. The NRF is responsible
for service discovery and maintaining network function profiles [129,130]. As it primarily
deals with control plane information, it can be virtualized without impacting QoS and
QoE [133]. Functions like the Network Slice Selection Function (NSSF) and Network
Exposure Function (NEF), not directly engaged in data plane operations, are also suitable
candidates for virtualization without compromising performance metrics [134].
6.2.2. Core Functions Complex for Virtualization
The User Plane Function (UPF) handles packet routing and forwarding, and it is
crucial to ensuring uninterrupted operation [129,130]. Even though UPF can be virtualized, doing so may impact QoS and QoE, especially in scenarios with high data rates or
strict latency requirements [134]. Therefore, careful consideration and proper resource
allocation are necessary to avoid degradation of QoS and QoE [134]. Similarly, the Access
and Mobility Management Function (AMF) is responsible for managing connections and
mobility [129,130]. Like UPF, AMF is time-sensitive as it must maintain seamless connectivity for mobile users [129,130]. Although AMF can be virtualized, achieving low latency
and high QoS/QoE in a virtualized environment could be challenging [135]. Additionally,
the Session Management Function (SMF) handles session establishment and maintenance.
While SMF can also be virtualized, maintaining high QoS/QoE presents challenges due to
its need for rapid response to session changes.

Future Internet 2025, 17, 161

27 of 39

6.2.3. Virtualization of RAN Functions
In a 5G RAN architecture, the BBU functionality is split into the CU and the DU [136].
The BBU can be virtualized using the OpenAir-Interface (OAI) software platform. However,
virtualizing the BBU can be challenging due to the high processing and timing requirements
on certain functions [137].
In a RAN, multiple functions can be virtualized [124]. The CU oversees multiple base
stations and manages network resources. Virtualizing the CU is easier than the DU because
it has lower processing requirements [138]. The control plane and user plane within the
CU can both be virtualized using off-the-shelf hardware [139]. Conversely, the DU handles
real-time Layer 1 and Layer 2 scheduling tasks [136]. Virtualizing the DU poses challenges
due to strict latency requirements and the necessity for real-time operations. Nonetheless,
technological advancements have facilitated the connection of the DU to the radio via
eCPRI, which can indeed be virtualized [139].
As per our knowledge, while documenting this article we did not find a specific list of
network functions that could not be virtualized using NFV. It is important to note that the
decision to virtualize a network function depends on various factors, such as the nature
of the function, performance requirements, and cost considerations. The feasibility of
virtualizing a network function is a subject of ongoing research and development in the
field of 5G and beyond cellular networks [140–142].

7. Proposed Architecture for Cellular System Based on SDN, NFV,
and C-RAN
Building on the energy efficiency challenges identified in Sections 3–5 (SDN scalability,
NFV performance overhead, C-RAN fronthaul limitations) and the convergence pitfalls
mentioned in Section 6, we propose a conceptual integrated architecture, as shown in
Figure 17.
A comprehensive review of energy-efficient cellular networks utilizing SDN, NFV,
and C-RAN technologies is presented as the primary focus of this article. The proposed
architecture shown in Figure 17 demonstrates how these enabling technologies could be
integrated into future cellular networks. This schematic representation is intended to serve
as a conceptual foundation rather than an implemented solution, as the current work is
focused on theoretical analysis and a survey of existing approaches. It is recognized that
quantitative validation through simulations or field testing would be required to fully assess
the proposed architecture’s performance and energy efficiency benefits. These important
practical evaluations have been planned as future work, with more details outlined in
Section 8. Here is the functionality of each element of the proposed architecture presented
in Figure 17:
•

5G Core Control Plane With Virtualized Core Functions: The core of the 5G and
beyond cellular network can be fully virtualized since flexibility is more important
for operators to support different use cases. Virtualization of the core will help to
develop quicker solutions/applications, and the developed solutions can be deployed
and tested faster. It could also pave the way for more innovative and flexible network
services, as network operators would have more freedom to customize and optimize
their networks based on a single, unified platform [97].
From an energy-efficiency perspective, virtualizing the 5G core delivers three significant benefits. First, hardware consolidation replaces dedicated appliances with
virtualized functions, reducing power consumption by up to 40% through improved
resource utilization [93]. Second, dynamic scaling enables core functions like UDM
and AUSF to automatically adjust resources based on demand, eliminating energy
waste during low-traffic periods. Third, by concentrating virtual resources in data

Future Internet 2025, 17, 161

•

centers rather than in distributed hardware, operators achieve 35% savings in cooling
costs through optimized thermal management [95].
SDN Controller: The SDN controller oversees the entire network element and manages the resource allocation based on the demands. This is a central point that manages the data flow in the network through SDN principles, making the network
programmable and more adaptable to varying traffic patterns and demands [97].
The SDN controller serves as the centralized intelligence for network-wide resource
management, directly addressing the critical energy efficiency challenges identified
in Section 6. By dynamically scaling resources to match real-time traffic patterns, it
eliminates energy waste from over-provisioning, reducing idle power consumption
compared to static architectures through optimal VNF placement [93]. The controller’s
global network view enables intelligent traffic routing that minimizes transmission
hops, cutting routing energy while maintaining QoS requirements.
Backhaul and Fronthaul Link: Fiber optic cables and microwave links are two options
for the backhaul connections that link the core network to the RAN architecture. Fiber
optic cables are more energy efficient under heavy load conditions, while microwave
links are better under low load conditions [48]. Fronthaul connects the BBUs in the CRAN architecture to RRUs on cell towers, typically using high-bandwidth, low-latency
connections such as fiber cables.
Cloud vRAN: The elements of C-RAN could also be virtualized to curtail the use of
energy. The C-RAN elements are given below:
–
–
–
–

•

•

BBU: Processes the baseband signal and is part of the C-RAN that can be centralized in a data center to serve multiple radio sites.
PHY (Physical Layer): The layer in the BBU that handles the physical connection
to the network.
MAC/RLC: These layers manage multiple access protocols and data transfer
reliability.
RRC/PDCP: These layers manage radio resources and the convergence of data
from different sources.

NFV in C-RAN: When NFV and C-RAN are combined, they offer more energyefficient, flexible, and scalable cellular networks. In C-RAN, functions with stringent
latency requirements, such as Digital Signal Processing (DSP), are deployed on the
dedicated hardware and co-located with RRHs. On the other hand, BBU functionalities
such as packet scheduling and user management could be virtualized since these
functions are not as latency sensitive and could be decoupled from hardware and
deployed as software instance [95].
User Equipment and Applications: This represents the devices and applications that
use the cellular network, such as smartphones, wearables, and vehicles.

This integrated architecture demonstrates a practical implementation of SDN, NFV,
and C-RAN technologies for next-generation cellular networks. Using SDN programmable
control, NFV flexible virtualization, and centralized processing for RAN using C-RAN, the
proposed cellular architecture addresses the critical energy efficiency challenges identified
throughout this article while maintaining the performance requirements of 5G and beyond.
Table 5 presents the key components of the proposed cellular architecture and their role
in addressing some challenges in the development of a sustainable cellular network. The
integration of centralized SDN control, the virtualized network functions of NFV, and
the resource optimization of C-RAN plays a key role in improving network efficiency
and reducing energy consumption. This holistic approach demonstrates how softwaredriven architectures can significantly improve scalability, flexibility, and sustainability in
next-generation cellular networks.

7.1. Interaction Between SDN Controller, NFV MANO, and C-RAN
The SDN controller is responsible for effectively managing the network resources
and data flow across the network infrastructure, while the network functions within the
core control plane have their specific roles in managing different aspects of the network’s

Future Internet 2025, 17, 161

signaling and control logic, as shown in Figure 17. Here is how the SDN controller and
network functions interact and manage the network functionality:
•

C-RAN Management:

•

Centralization: The SDN controller can centralize the control of the C-RAN
infrastructure, allowing for the pooling of BBUs that can be dynamically assigned
to RRUs based on the current network load and demand.
Network Optimization: Through the SDN controller, the network can optimize
the routing of traffic between the RRUs and BBUs. It can also manage the split of
control and user plane functions to improve performance and efficiency.
Dynamic Configuration: The SDN controller enables the dynamic reconfiguration
of network resources in response to changing traffic patterns. This will help
C-RAN to allocate and reallocate radio resources in real-time.

Oversees the Underlying Network Infrastructure: In the proposed architecture,
the SDN controller does not directly handle the core network functions. Instead,
it oversees the underlying network infrastructure. This infrastructure allows various network functions such as signaling, session management, and authentication
to communicate with each other and with the radio access network. The SDN
controller ensures that the data plane where actual data flows aligns smoothly
with the control plane where decisions are made, resulting in an efficient and
agile network [104].
Interconnectivity: Figure 18 shows the layered architecture of the integration
of SDN and NFV systems. It is similar to SDN architecture and consists of
infrastructure, control, and application layers. It utilizes the principle of NFV
to facilitate the implementation and management of network functions. The
SDN controller orchestrates network resources to ensure proper communication
among VNFs. Under the management of the VIM, the controller can modify
network behavior as required, responding to network user requests [97]. The SDN
controller and NFV MANO work together to improve network services. SDN
enhances NFV by providing better traffic steering and service chaining. MANO
is responsible for managing and orchestrating the virtual network resources and
connections between VNFs for a complete network service. This requires the
SDN controller and MANO to collaborate for efficient traffic routing [104].
Deployment and Orchestration: The SDN controller, in collaboration with NFV
orchestration tools, can deploy and manage the lifecycle of VNFs, such as scaling
out or in, based on the network’s requirements. As depicted in Figure 19, the
network orchestration function is utilized to establish network service chaining policies. These policies are also shared with the SDN controller within the
NFVI networking layer through the NFV MANO framework. This collaboration
provides efficient traffic routing and enhances overall network services [104].
Policy Enforcement: The SDN controller can enforce network policies at a granular
level, directing specific types of traffic to pass through certain VNFs for processing,
such as firewalls and load balancers.

Integration of SDN with C-RAN and VNF:
–

Flexibility and Scalability: By integrating SDN with C-RAN and VNFs, the
network gains flexibility and scalability, allowing it to support a wide range of
services and adapt to changes in traffic patterns or network conditions.

Future Internet 2025, 17, 161

Resource Utilization: The SDN controller enhances resource utilization by matching computing and radio resources with network demands in real-time, which is

In summary, NFV and SDN both help make networks more flexible and adaptable, but
they do different jobs that work well together. NFV focuses on making network functions
virtual, which means they are more flexible and efficient. SDN, on the other hand, provides
the tools to manage and organize these virtual functions across the network. The SDN
controller acts as the brain of the network. It makes decisions to make sure everything
runs smoothly, including both the C-RAN and the VNFs. This teamwork between NFV
and SDN is crucial for delivering fast, reliable, and adaptable service, especially with the
demands of advanced cellular networks like 5G and beyond.

8. Conclusions
In this paper, a comprehensive survey of energy-efficient cellular networks was presented, focusing on the transformative potential of SDN, NFV, and C-RAN to reduce power
consumption and enable sustainable 5G and beyond networks. Through a systematic
analysis of the existing literature, key trends, challenges, and solutions in green telecommunications were identified. A conceptual architecture that integrates SDN, NFV, and C-RAN
was discussed, demonstrating the potential of these technologies to significantly improve
energy efficiency. However, the primary contribution of this work is considered to be the
thorough review of state-of-the-art approaches rather than the detailed implementation of
a specific architecture.
In Table 1, prior works are categorized based on their contributions to hardware
efficiency, renewable energy integration, and emerging paradigms. This structured classification provides valuable insights into existing research efforts, highlighting areas where
further advancements are needed. The convergence of SDN, NFV, and C-RAN has been
identified as a promising pathway to achieving energy savings of approximately 40 to 50%
through dynamic resource allocation, hardware consolidation, and centralized processing.
Nevertheless, several critical challenges remain, including issues related to interoperability
in multi-vendor SDN/NFV environments and the absence of standardized frameworks to
ensure scalability.
It is recommended that future research focuses on the following areas:
•

•
•
•

Quantitative validation: Simulations or testbed implementations should be conducted
to evaluate the real-world energy efficiency of the proposed architectures under
diverse traffic conditions.
AI-driven optimization: Machine-learning techniques should be employed to enhance
SDN/NFV orchestration, enabling more intelligent resource management.
Standardization efforts: Interoperability gaps, particularly in Open RAN and hybrid
cloud-edge deployments, should be addressed to facilitate seamless integration.
6G integration: The convergence with emerging technologies, such as terahertz communication and quantum networking, should be explored to further advance sustainability goals.

By addressing these challenges, the transition from theoretical frameworks to practical
implementations can be facilitated, ensuring that green networking principles become
embedded in future cellular infrastructure. This review is intended to serve as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners aiming to develop energy-efficient
cellular networks, thereby promoting the adoption of sustainable practices within the
telecom industry.
