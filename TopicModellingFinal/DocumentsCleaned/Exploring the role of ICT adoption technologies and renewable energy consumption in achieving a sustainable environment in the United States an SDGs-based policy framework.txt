Exploring the role of ICT adoption technologies and renewable energy consumption in achieving a sustainable environment in the United States: an SDGsbased policy framework

In recent decades, rapid development has exacerbated climate challenges, posing serious threats to ecological sustainability. To address these issues, renewable energy, ICT technologies, financial development, and globalization have emerged as essential tools for mitigating ecological impacts and fostering green economic growth. These measures align closely with the goals of COP 28, the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. However, the United States faces considerable challenges in reconciling socioeconomic development with environmental sustainability. This study, therefore, investigates the key drivers ofCO2 emissions (CO2) in the United States using data from 1990Q1 to 2021Q4. The study employs wavelet quantile-onquantile regression along with quantile cointegration to analyze these dynamics across different quantiles and timeframes. The results from the study showed that across all quantiles and periods, ICT adoption technologies and fiscal decentralization increase CO2, while globalization, renewable energy consumption and financial development lessen CO2.

Introduction Over the past several years, the concept of sustainable development has become a fundamental aspect of global discussions on how to align socio-economic advancement with environmental conservation. This evolving discourse has driven the development of major international initiatives, such as the sustainable development goals (SDGs). These frameworks aim to foster worldwide prosperity by prioritizing sustainable resource use, clean energy transitions, technological innovations, and emissions reductions [26, 66]. The SDGs have provided nations with a well-defined blueprint to address sustainability challenges, focusing on clean energy utilization, advancing technology, reducing carbon footprints, and enhancing efficient economic practices [9, 16, 21]. Sustainable development now underpins a multitude of policy agendas, strategic frameworks, and sector-specific activities across economic blocs and individual countries, underscoring its vital role in the global pursuit of balanced and resilient development [12, 38, 40, 43]. The United States, a major global economic and environmental player, contributes approximately 25.93% of the worlds GDP in 20231 and accounted for 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions, while China represented 29%,2 positioning it as a crucial focus for international carbon reduction strategies. The slow pace of progress towards reducing emissions is partly due to the inherent tension between socio-economic growth and environmental sustainability. As an advanced economy, the United States faces challenges in balancing economic development with the need for sustainable environmental practices. Renewable energy adoption plays a pivotal role in the countrys strategy to address climate change while maintaining economic growth. The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is vital for the economic and environmental landscape of the United States. However, despite significant strides, reliance on traditional energy sources still poses challenges to achieving carbon neutrality. Several studies have highlighted the environmental benefits of renewable energy, emphasizing its potential to significantly reduce emissions while supporting economic growth [1, 3, 6, 7]. However, the slow adoption rate and the ongoing dependence on carbon-intensive energy sources create obstacles in achieving sustainability goals. As the US continues to shift towards renewable energy, the challenge lies in enhancing the scale of https://www.statista.com/topics/7747/gross-domestic-product-gdp-world wide/#topicOverview. https://net0.com/blog/greenhouse-gas-emissions-in-the-united-states. of 26 clean energy deployment while ensuring economic competitiveness. Achieving this balance is critical to reducing carbon emissions and aligning with the broader goal of sustainable development, ultimately helping to mitigate the impact of climate change both domestically and globally [11, 13, 68]. Another key factor shaping sustainable development is the adoption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). ICT adoption plays a crucial role in driving innovation, particularly in green technologies, which are vital for reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable growth. In the United States, ICT adoption has been instrumental in expanding green energy technologies and improving energy efficiencyboth of which are essential for achieving carbon reduction targets [5, 22, 33, 41]. Despite these advances, however, significant gaps remain in the integration of green technologies and the development of sustainable infrastructure. Technologies such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power are pivotal in decoupling economic growth from environmental harm [29, 32, 46]. In alignment with SDGs 7 and 9, which emphasize affordable and sustainable energy as well as fostering innovation, ICT serves as a critical tool in the global fight against climate change [53, 67]. However, the pace of green technology adoption in the United States has lagged behind what is necessary to achieve the ambitious goals set by the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. The reasons for this lag are multifaceted, including limited financial resources, technological disparities, and a short-term focus on economic gains rather than prioritizing longterm environmental sustainability. Moreover, globalization plays a dual rolewhile it facilitates the exchange of green technologies and best practices, it can also contribute to disparities in technological access and adoption, further complicating efforts to accelerate sustainable progress [4, 10, 14, 15]. Given the challenges posed by rising C O2, this study seeks to address the gap in understanding how the United States can leverage renewable energy adoption, ICT technologies, fiscal decentralization, globalization, and financial development to accelerate progress towards carbon neutrality. Particularly, this study explores the interrelationship between renewable energy consumption, ICT adoption, globalization, fiscal decentralization, and CO2 emissions in the United States. It hypothesizes that increased investment in renewable energy, the effective use of ICT, well-managed decentralization policies, and financial development can significantly mitigate CO2 without compromising economic growth. By focusing on SDGs 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13, this study aims to provide actionable insights into how the United States can balance economic development with its ecological responsibilities. The objective of this study is to investigate how these variables influence CO2 in the United States. The study contributes to the broader goals of Sustainable Development GoalsSDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and SDG 13 (Climate Action)by analyzing these relationships and offering insights into how the United States can achieve a balance between economic growth and ecological sustainability. The study aims to provide information for policy recommendations that promote sustainable development practices, enabling the United States to progress economically while reducing its environmental impact. The following three key questions are designed to further define and guide the objectives of this study: a. What is the impact of renewable energy consumption and ICT adoption technologies on CO2 in the United States? b. How do fiscal decentralization, globalization, and financial development influence CO2 emissions in the United States? c. How can the United States balance environmental sustainability with technological adoption and policy interventions to achieve SDGs 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13? Contributions and novelty of the study This study is centred on the United States, considering its economic significance, technological advancements, and pivotal role in global trade and policy development. The United States possesses vast resources, including fossil fuels, renewable energy sources, forests, mineral deposits, and extensive arable land for agriculture, which are crucial for its economic development and its contribution to international agreements and trade. As a major industrialized nation, the United States is also a leading contributor to global C O2, which positions it as a key player in the fight against climate change. The increasing trend of C O2 is a critical challenge, posing a threat to climate change mitigation and sustainable development goals (SDGs). The United States, as a signatory to the Paris Agreement, faces significant pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through effective policy interventions. With the growing importance of renewable energy and the adoption of ICT technologies, as well as the effects of globalization, this study explores their impact on C O2 in the United States. Understanding the role of renewable energy consumption and ICT in reducing emissions is essential for advancing the nations climate goals and achieving sustainable development. Furthermore, globalizations influence on emissions underlines the interconnectedness of economies and the need for coordinated international efforts to tackle environmental issues. This study aims to contribute to both theoretical understanding and policymaking by assessing how renewable energy, technological adoption, and globalization interact with C O2 in the context of the United States, providing insights for more effective strategies to address climate and development challenges. a. In theoretical terms, this investigation enriches the existing literature on achieving the SDGs in the United States. It addresses significant gaps in prior research, particularly the limited simultaneous assessment of multiple SDGs, which has hindered a holistic evaluation of progress towards the 2030 targets. This study also offers new evidence concerning research and development expenditure in the context of six specific SDGs, thereby enhancing our understanding of their interlinkages. By concurrently analyzing these five SDGs, the study demonstrates a level of versatility and breadth that marks a substantial advancement in the academic discourse. This contribution moves beyond merely reaffirming existing findings, providing novel insights into the roles of renewable energy consumption, ICT adoption, fiscal decentralization, and financial development in mitigating CO2 in the United States, thereby significantly advancing the body of economic literature on sustainable development. b. In practical terms, this study reveals significant policy implications regarding the drivers of C O2 in the United States. Based on these insights, the study advocates for targeted measures to mitigate the environmental impact of ICT adoption by investing in energy-efficient technologies and ensuring that fiscal decentralization policies include strong environmental standards. In addition, the study emphasizes the need to enhance investments in renewable energy and strengthen financial development as a means to support green growth. Promoting globalizations role in technology transfer and green innovations can further contribute to emissions reductions. These strategies are vital for achieving the SDGs, particularly goals 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13, which emphasize affordable and clean energy, sustainable economic growth, resilient infrastructure and innovation, sustainable cities and communities, and climate action on a national scale. c. Methodologically, this study makes significant contributions by introducing two novel techniques. First, the study implements a quantile cointegration test, which combines the quantile approach of Li et al. with the widely used bounds testing pro cedure suggested by Pesaran et al. . Unlike conventional cointegration tests, this method captures the cointegration relationship between independent and dependent variables across different quantiles of the dependent variable, providing a more nuanced understanding of the long-run relationships at different points of the distribution. Second, the study introduces an enhanced version of wavelet quantileon-quantile regression (WQQR) that incorporates p value assessment. This approach is distinct from the WQQR proposed by Oktay et al. (2024), as it captures the significance level of the associations across various quantiles of both dependent and independent variables. By incorporating these advanced techniques, the study offers a more robust analysis of the relationships between variables over different quantiles and time horizons. This methodological advancement enables the development of more refined policy recommendations, providing policymakers with better guidelines for targeted, quantilespecific, and period-sensitive interventions The subsequent sections are guided as follows: Sect. "Literature review" summarizes past studies. Sect. "Theoretical underpinning" discusses the data and methods. Sect. "Data and methods" discusses the results, and Sect. "Conclusion and policy remarks" concludes the study in conjunction with policy guidelines.

Literature review Studies on ICT and CO2 have presented mixed findings. For instance, An Hign et al. analyzed data from 116 developing and 26 developed countries between 1995 and 2010, concluding that ICT adoption plays a key role in reducing C O2. Their findings are corroborated by Zhang and Liu , who, through panel regression analysis, found that ICT adoption significantly decreased CO2 in China from 2000 to 2010. Similar conclusions were drawn by Ben Lahouel et al. and Jahanger et al. . Ben Lahouel et al. employed logistic smooth transition regression on Tunisias data from 1970 to 2018, and their findings align with the idea that ICT can effectively lower CO2. Jahanger et al. reached a similar conclusion using MMQR for top nuclear energy countries from 1990 to 2017, adding support to the argument that ICT innovations may facilitate environmental improvements, even in countries with advanced energy sectors. Contrastingly, Usman et al. found no significant relationship between ICT adoption and C O2 in nine selected Asian economies from 1990 to 2018. The ARDL results suggest that ICT adoption in these regions may not yet be sufficiently integrated with climate policies to make a meaningful impact on CO2. This discrepancy raises questions regarding the regional effectiveness of ICT as a tool for CO2 reduction. Shobande and Asongu also support the argument that ICT can have a negative environmental impact. Their study on Nigeria and South Africa from 1990 to 2017 found, using the VAR/ VEC Granger causality technique, that ICT adoption significantly increased CO2. Table 1 presents summary of the reviewed papers. Regarding the association between REC and C O2, studies have been conducted across various countries and contexts, with the majority of these studies revealing the positive effect of REC on the environment, though some studies refute this claim. For instance, Sadiq et al. investigated the BRICS-1 countries using CS-ARDL for the period 19902020. Their findings indicate that REC reduces CO2, supporting the argument that renewable energy adoption in these rapidly growing economies helps mitigate environmental degradation. Similarly, Saba and AlNemer et al. found that REC is instrumental in reducing CO2 in South Africa and Saudi Arabia, respectively. Saba used an ARDL model for the period between 1960 and 2019, while AlNemer et al. employed wavelet coherence analysis for data spanning 19602020. These studies collectively highlight that in diverse contextsfrom emerging economies like BRICS-1 to oil-rich Saudi Arabiarenewable energy can play a pivotal role in decreasing emissions and improving ecological quality. Conversely, Shabbir Alam et al. presented evidence to the contrary in the case of India, where their BARDL Table 1 Impact of ICT on CO2 Author(s) Nation(s) Periods Techniques Finding An Hign et al. 116 developing and 26 developed countries 19952010 OLS ICT CO2 Zhang and Liu China 20002010 Panel Regression Usman et al. 9 selected Asian economies 19902018 ARDL ICT CO2 Ben Lahouel et al.

Top nuclear energy countries 1990 to 2017 MMQR Shobande and Asongu Nigeria and South Africa VAR/VEC Granger causality ICT CO2 regression results from 1990Q1 to 2018Q4 suggested that increased REC is associated with rising C O2. This counterintuitive finding could be attributed to the efficiency and integration issues in Indias renewable energy sector, where reliance on biomass and other less efficient forms of renewable energy may not yet yield substantial carbon reductions. Hasanov et al. added further complexity to the debate by showing that there is no significant relationship between REC and CO2 in oil-producing countries between 1991 and 2019, using an ADL model. This finding suggests that the high reliance on fossil fuels in these countries might undermine the effectiveness of renewable energy in curbing CO2. On the other hand, provided evidence from the United Kingdom, using a quantile approach to data from 1990 to 2021, which demonstrated that REC significantly reduced C O2. Table 2 presents a summary of the reviewed papers. The relationship between financial development (FD) and CO2 has yielded mixed results in the literature. For instance, Wu et al. analyzed data from Nordic countries between 1980 and 2020 using partial wavelet and multiple wavelet techniques. Their findings indicate that FD has a mitigating effect on CO2, suggesting that in these countries, financial growth has been accompanied by investments in cleaner technologies and sustainable practices. Contrasting these findings, Wang et al. [61, 62] explored the impact of FD on CO2 across 92 countries during the period 20072018 using a threshold value authenticity test. Their results showed that financial development is linked to increased CO2, implying that FD may facilitate energy-intensive activities, leading to higher emissions, especially in countries without stringent environmental regulations. Similarly, Wang et al. found that FD increased C O2 in European countries from 1995 to 2020, as indicated by their augmented mean group analysis. These findings reflect that, even in developed regions, FD may not always align with sustainability if financial resources are not directed towards green investments. Ofori et al. offered another perspective by analyzing BRICS, MINT, and G7 countries using a pooled OLS-fixed model from 1996 to 2020. Their results suggest that FD contributes to reducing CO2, which is consistent with the findings for the Nordic countries. This indicates that the positive effects of FD on environmental quality can be generalized to both developing and developed economies when there is an emphasis on sustainable financing and investments in green technologies. Sunday Adebayo et al. used a time-varying (bootstrap) rolling-window technique to examine MINT countries between 1969 and 2019 and found mixed results. Table 3 presents a summary of the reviewed papers. The literature investigating the impact of globalization (GO) on CO2 shows a predominantly positive relationship, with globalization tending to reduce emissions. However, some contrasting findings indicate that the effects of globalization may not be universally beneficial and could vary depending on the region, development stage, and policies in place. For instance, Chen et al. found that globalization reduces CO2 in 38 developed and developing economies from 1990 to 2019 using panel regression. This finding is corroborated by Borowiec and Papie , Table 2 Impact of renewable energy consumption on CO2 CS-ARDL REC CO2 1990q12018q4 BARDL REC CO2 South Africa 19602019 Saudi Arabia 19602020 Wavelet coherence analysis Hasanov et al. oil-producing countries 19912019 REC CO2 Olanrewaju and Kirikkaleli United Kingdom 19902021 Quantile approach Sadiq et al.

European countries 19952020 Augmented Mean Group who used the DCCEMG model to analyse the same set of countries from 1992 to 2019 and also concluded that globalization helps to lower emissions. Their studies collectively imply that the integration of international trade and capital flows facilitates the transfer of green technologies and best practices, thereby enhancing environmental quality in both advanced and emerging economies. Similarly, Yameogo et al. employed the CupFM technique to assess the impact of globalization on CO2 in landlocked African countries between 1980 and 2018. Their findings also indicate a reduction in CO2. Fang et al. found similar results in OECD countries from 1990 to 2019 using panel GMM, emphasizing the effectiveness of globalization in advanced economies with stringent environmental regulations and a focus on sustainable development. Luo and Kamarudin extended the analysis to G7 and BRIC countries from 1992 to 2020, employing a quantile regression approach. Their findings indicate that globalization reduces CO2 across different quantiles. However, not all studies align with this optimistic view. Shahbaz et al. found that globalization increased CO2 in 25 developed economies between 1970 and 2014 using the CCEMG and AMG techniques. This finding indicates that globalization, if not managed effectively, can lead to increased emissions through intensified economic activities and industrial growth that rely heavily on fossil fuels. Similarly, Rahman and Alam found that globalization contributes to increasing C O2 in Asian countries from 1960 to 2020 using the PCSE technique. These points to a potential downside of globalization, where economic activities facilitated by globalization could lead to environmental degradation, particularly in regions with lax environmental regulations or where the focus on economic growth overshadows sustainability concerns. Table 4 presents a summary of the reviewed papers. Indepth analysis of existing literature A review of recent literature on the impact of ICT, renewable energy consumption, financial development, fiscal decentralization, and globalization on CO2 highlights deficiencies in methodology, variable selection, and sample scope. a. Methodological limitations: Many studies investigating the these relationships [19, 49, 53, 60, 65, 69] face significant methodological limitations. This research introduces an innovative integration of quantile and wavelet techniques by proposing the wavelet quantile-on-quantile regression (WQQR) with p values. Unlike previous studies that have treated quantile and wavelet methodologies separately, this study combines them, enabling more precise policy recommendations. In addition, this research addresses the gap in the literature by introducing quantile cointegration, which allows for the identification of cointegration relationships across different quantiles of the dependent variable. This approach provides a deeper understanding of the dynamics at various quantile levels, supporting more targeted policy interventions. b. Narrow scope of analysis: One significant limitation of most previous studies is their narrow scope of analysis. Many fail to adequately conceptualize and integrate the relevant variables, particularly regarding the inclusion of ICT and financial development. Even the few studies that do examine ICT and financial development [53, 60, 63, 69] often fall short of linking their findings to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure). Furthermore, most existing research tends to focus on only one or two SDGs, which limits their applicability in the broader context of attaining all SDGs by 2030. This restricted approach limits our ability to make comprehensive assessments of overall progress towards sustainable development, emphasizing the Table 4 Impact of globalisation on C O2 Chen et al. 38 developed and developing economies 19902019 Panel regression GO CO2 Borowiec and Papie 38 countries 19922019 DCCEMG model Yameogo et al. landlocked African countries 19802018 CupFM Fang et al.

Bridging the gaps: This study addresses the existing gaps by adopting a broader analytical framework, examining the impacts of ICT, renewable energy, fiscal decentralization, financial development, and globalization on CO2 in the United States from 1990Q1 to 2021Q4. By employing advanced econometric techniques, such as wavelet quantile-on-quantile regression and quantile cointegration, the study provides a nuanced exploration of how these factors influence CO2 across different quantiles. These methodologies effectively account for issues of nonlinearity, non-normality, and stationarity, thereby offering more robust insights into the dynamic relationships at play, which are critical for formulating evidencebased environmental policy. Furthermore, the study bridges the identified gaps by linking its findings to the achievement of multiple SDGs, emphasizing its relevance in advancing sustainable development. By introducing wavelet quantile-on-quantile regression and quantile cointegration, the study provides deeper insights into the impacts of ICT, renewable energy, fiscal decentralization, financial development, and globalization on C O2. Based on these findings, the study recommends targeted policy actions to achieve specific SDG targets. This comprehensive approach highlights the studys contribution to advancing the SDG agenda in the United States.

Theoretical underpinning The theoretical framework for analysing how these variables impact CO2 is grounded in the EKC hypothesis and the theory of ecological modernization. The EKC hypothesis posits an inverted U-shaped relationship between economic development and environmental degradation, suggesting that emissions initially increase with economic growth but eventually decrease as economies mature and adopt cleaner technologies . In this context, ICT and financial development can serve as critical drivers for both economic growth and environmental improvement. ICT is considered a key factor in reducing CO2 through enhancing energy efficiency, supporting digital technologies, and facilitating the transition to less carbon-intensive production processes . However, there is also evidence that ICT expansion can increase emissions due to higher electricity consumption, particularly in regions lacking a renewable energy infrastructure [38, 40, 60]. Renewable energy consumption is another significant factor that influences CO2. According to ecological modernization theory, the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources leads to environmental improvements by reducing emissions [8, 34, 49]. Renewable energy not only lowers the carbon intensity of production processes but also mitigates the environmental impact of energy consumption. However, some studies argue that the transition to renewable energy can be costly and may initially lead to increased emissions due to the infrastructure needed to support renewable energy generation [18, 47]. Fiscal decentralization, on the other hand, is often associated with improved environmental quality, as local governments may be better positioned to implement targeted policies that encourage sustainable energy use and reduce CO2 emissions [25, 36]. However, conflicting evidence suggests that decentralization could also lead to an uneven distribution of resources and regulatory discrepancies, potentially increasing emissions in regions with less stringent policies [28, 49]. Globalization and financial development further complicate the relationship with CO2. Globalization is theorized to have both positive and negative effects on environmental quality. On one hand, it can facilitate the transfer of green technologies and practices across borders, thereby reducing emissions [20, 23, 30]. On the other hand, increased international trade and economic activity can lead to greater resource consumption and emissions, especially in developing countries that prioritize growth over environmental protection [42, 56]. Financial development also presents a dual role: it can either enhance the adoption of environmentally friendly technologies by increasing access to funding [44, 64] or exacerbate emissions by financing energy-intensive projects (F. [61, 62], p. 92, R. ). These mixed findings highlight the complexity of understanding how ICT, renewable energy, financial development, fiscal decentralization, and globalization interact to shape C O2 emissions, making it imperative to consider contextual factors, such as policy frameworks, institutional quality, and technological readiness. Next, we present the hypotheses formulated based on the above theoretical framework: H1: Increase in ICT increase United States C emissions H2: Increase in renewable energy consumption decrease United States CO2 emissions H3: Higher financial development decrease United States CO2 emissions H4: Increase in fiscal decentralization increase CO2 emissions in the United States. H5: Increased globalization leads to decrease in CO2 in the United States Data and methods Data In this study, we examine how ICT adoption technologies, renewable energy consumption and financial development impact C O2. The role of fiscal decentralisation and globalisation is also considered. The independent is CO2 which is measured as per capita and its at https:// ourworldindata.org/g rapher/co-emissions- p er-c apita. The independent variables are ICT adoption technologies measured as Fixed telephone subscriptions and obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ict-adoption? tab=chart&countr y=~USA, renewable energy consumption (REC) is calculated as per capita (KWH) and its obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ per-capita-renewables, financial development is an index which encompassed financial institutions and financial market access and its obtained from https://data.imf.org/ myprofile?tb=Downloads, fiscal decentralization (FID) is measured as an index and its gathered from https:// data.imf.org/myprofile?tb=Downloads, and globalization (GO) is measured as an index and obtained from https:// kof.ethz.ch/en/forecasts-and-indicators/indicators/kof- globalisation-index.html. Data for this study cover the period from 1990 to 2021. The study converts the data from its natural form to a logarithmic scale to stabilize variance, thus helping to reduce heteroskedasticity and promote a more normal distribution. To address the challenge of a limited sample size, we transformed the annual data into quarterly intervals, following the investigations of and . Consequently, the analysis utilizes data from 1990Q1 to 2021Q4. Table 5 presents the descriptive statistics for the variables CO2, FD, FID, GO, ICT, and REC. The mean values indicate the central tendency of the data, with CO2 having an average of 2.927 and ICT showing the highest mean of 18.811. The standard deviations highlight the variability, with REC exhibiting the most variability (0.252) and GO the least (0.048). The skewness values suggest that most of the variables are negatively skewed, except for REC, indicating that the majority of their values are concentrated on the higher end. The kurtosis values indicate that FD has a leptokurtic distribution, as it exceeds a value of 3, while other variables tend to be closer to a normal distribution. The JarqueBera test results indicate significant departures from normality for CO2, FD, GO, ICT, and REC, as evidenced by p values less than 0.05. These findings suggest that the data exhibit a mix of statistical properties, including varying degrees of skewness and kurtosis, which may impact further analysis using linear techniques. Empirical methods Quantile cointegration (QC) The bounds testing approach by Pesaran et al. extends the Engle and Granger cointegration methodology to accommodate variables with different orders of integration, making it suitable for analyzing cointegration relationships, where variables are not necessarily integrated of the same order. The ARDL bounds test is defined as follows: Yt = 0 + p i=1 i Yti + q i=0 i Xti + 1 Yt1 + 2 Xt1 + t (1) where yt denotes the first difference of the dependent variable yt , and 0 stands for constant (intercept). Moreover, i andi stand for coefficients representing the shortterm dynamics of yt andxt . Furthermore, pandq denote the lag of yt andxt . Moreover, 1 and2 represent the longrun coefficients between yt andxt . t represents the error term. ARDL bounds test primarily focuses on estimating the average or mean relationship between variables in a time series model. This means that it assesses the cointegration relationship based on the average behaviour of the entire sample, without considering how the relationship Table 5 Descriptive statistics CO2 FD FID GO ICT REC Mean 2.927 0.167 0.607 4.360 18.811 8.481 Median 2.994 0.096 0.604 4.371 18.833 8.389 Maximum 3.063 0.078 0.501 4.412 19.077 9.018 Minimum 2.622 0.536 0.757 4.230 18.385 8.026 Std.

This study addressed this limitation by merging the quantile aspect suggested by Li et al. ) with the bounds testing approach suggested by Pesaran et al. . This is known as Quantile Cointegration (QC). The QC is defined as follows: Q (Yt ); = 0, + wavelet-transformed quantile of the x at quantile . et denotes error term. In this study, we differentiate our approach from Ozkan et al. slightly by modifying the WQQR model to incorporate significant values across all quantiles and time periods for both dependent and independent vari i, Q (Yti ) + i, Xti + 1, Q (Yt1 ) +2, Xt1 + t, where Q () denotes the conditional quantile function at quantile and 0, stand for intercept quantile . Besides, i, andi, stand for quantile-specific coefficients for the lagged differences of yt andxt , and 1, , and2, represent the coefficients of the lagged levels yt andxt at quantile . The error term at quantile is denoted by i,t. Wavelet quantileonquantile regression The quantile-on-quantile regression (QQR) suggested by Sim and Zhou is an extension of the quantile regression introduced by . The QQR enables the capturing of the impact of quantiles of x on quantiles of y . Equation 4 disclosed the QQR: yt = 0 (, ) + 1 , xi,t xi +et (4)   where yt and xi,t denotes the dependent variable and independent variable. Moreover, 1 (, ) and 0 (, ) signify slope coefficients and intercept. Furthermore, et signifies the error term at quantile . Following the inability of the quantile-on-quantile regression to capture the relationship across all periods, Ozkan et al. introduced the wavelet quantile-onquantile regression (WQQR). The WQQR can identify the effect of independent variable on dependent variable across all quantiles and time horizons.3 The WQQR is specified as follows: +et dj [yt ] = 0 (, ) + 1 (, ) dj [xi,t ] dj xi   ables. Figure 1 presents the flow of the study. Findings and discussion Preestimation tests results Table 6 showcases the BDS (Brock, Dechert, and Scheinkman) test result. In the context of the BDS test results, the null hypothesis typically posits that the underlying time series data is linear. The test statistics indicate a rejection of this null hypothesis at 1% level of significance. This rejection implies strong evidence that the relationships between variablesCO2, FD, FID, GO, ICT, and RECare nonlinear over the specified dimensions (M2 to M6). Therefore, based on the BDS test results, the null hypothesis of linearity is rejected, indicating that these variables exhibit significant nonlinear dynamics that warrant further investigation and modeling using appropriate nonlinear techniques. Figure 2 shows the results of the QQ plots. The QQ plot shows the distribution of the sample quantiles for variables (CO2, FD, FID, GO, ICT, REC) against the theoretical quantiles of a normal distribution. The null states that data follows a normal distribution. Ideally, if the data follows a normal distribution, the points should align along the straight diagonal reference line. However, for most variables here, noticeable deviations from the line 3.

This suggests that the distributions of C O2, FD, FID, GO, ICT, and REC are not perfectly normal, thus refuting the null hypothesis for all variables due to their deviation from the straight line. Based on the BDS test results affirming the series nonlinear attributes and the QQ plot results indicating deviation from a normal distribution, using linear techniques would produce misleading results. Therefore, the study employed nonlinear techniques to investigate these dynamics more accurately. Quantile unit root Figure 3 shows the quantile augmented DickeyFuller (ADF) test results for the studied variables across different quantiles. The null hypothesis for the QADF test is that the variable under consideration has a unit root across all quantiles, implying that it is non-stationary. The dashed and dotted lines represent critical values at different significance levels, such as 1%, 5%, or 10%. Suppose the ADF test statistic for a given quantile falls below the critical value. In that case, we reject the null hypothesis of non-stationarity for that quantile, suggesting that the variable is stationary. In this plot, we observe that the test statistics vary across quantiles, with some quantiles having values below the critical thresholds, indicating stationarity, while others do not. This suggests that the stationarity of these variables may be quantile-dependent, implying heterogeneity in the stationarity properties across different levels of the distribution. Quantile cointegration Figure 4 presents quantile cointegration test results for CO2 and its drivers, including ICT, REC, FID, FD, and GO, across different quantiles. The quantile cointegration test is used to assess whether a long-term equilibrium relationship exists between C O2 and the explanatory variables at various quantiles of their distributions. The null hypothesis for the cointegration test is that there is no cointegration relationship, meaning that the variables do not move together in the long run across different quantiles. The F-statistic values are plotted against quantiles, and the dashed lines represent critical values at different significance levels. When the F-statistic exceeds the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting the presence of a cointegration relationship for that quantile. The results show variability in the F-statistics across quantiles for each panel. In some quantiles, the F-statistic exceeds the critical thresholds (e.g., red, blue, and green dashed lines), indicating evidence of cointegration between CO2 and ICT (Panel A), C O2 and REC (Panel B), CO2 and FID (Panel C), CO2 and FD (Panel D), and CO2 and GO (Panel E) for those quantiles. This implies that the long-term relationship between C O2 and the Fig. 3 Quantile ADF test results. the dotted, dashed and strong black lines denotes critical values of 3.49, 2.89, and 2.58 corresponds to 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively Fig. 4 Quantile PSS Bounds Test Estimates. Green, blue, and red lines represent upper bound critical values of the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively explanatory variables may differ depending on the quantile under consideration. Such heterogeneous effects across quantiles could reflect different dynamics in the relationship between CO2 and these factors, indicating that a uniform, average-based cointegration approach may not fully capture the full interactions between the variables. Wavelet quantileonquantile regression result We then applied wavelet quantile-on-quantile regression, incorporating p values, to assess the impact of the independent variable on the dependent variable across different quantiles and time periods, emphasizing statistical significance. Figure 5 shows the impact of ICT adoption technologies (ICT) on C O2 emissions ( CO2) in the United States. In the short-term (Panel A), the impact of ICT adoption is consistently positive across all quantiles, suggesting that increased ICT adoption leads to higher CO2, regardless of the level of emissions. This indicates that in the short run, the expansion of ICT infrastructure, energy consumption related to data centres, and increased use of electronic devices contribute significantly to rising emissions. In the medium-term (Panel B), the positive relationship between ICT and C O2 persists across all quantiles, implying that ICTs energy-intensive nature continues to drive higher emissions despite potential efficiency gains. Finally, in the long-term (Panel C), the positive effect is maintained, which may reflect the sustained energy demands associated with the growth of ICT infrastructure and digital services over time. Our discoveries are consistent with studies like Shobande and Asongu , which highlight that ICT adoption tends to increase energy consumption, leading to higher emissions, particularly when the energy supply is reliant on fossil fuels. Similarly, Usman et al. have also found that ICT can drive CO2 due to increased electricity usage from expanding ICT activities. However, these results are in contrast to the findings of Ben Lahouel et al. , who argued that ICT adoption generally reduces C O2 through efficiency gains and improved energy management. The positive effect observed in the figure suggests that the United States may need to implement complementary policies, such as transitioning towards renewable energy sources and improving ICT energy efficiency, to mitigate the emissions resulting from ICT growth. Figure 6 shows the effect of REC on C O2 across different quantiles and time periods. In the short-term (Panel A), renewable energy consumption appears to have a consistently negative impact on CO2 across all quantiles, implying that increased adoption of renewable energy leads to a reduction in emissions regardless of the initial emissions level. This negative impact is particularly evident at higher quantiles, suggesting that regions or sectors with higher CO2 benefit more from renewable energy consumption. In the medium-term (Panel B), the impact remains negative across all quantiles, but the magnitude decreases slightly compared to the shortterm, indicating a sustained but slightly diminished effectiveness of renewable energy in reducing emissions, as other factors might come into play. In the long-term (Panel C), the negative effect continues, and the relationship remains consistent across different quantiles, suggesting a lasting reduction in CO2 with greater renewable energy adoption. These findings are consistent with studies, such as those by Sadiq et al. , which found that REC significantly reduces C O2 by replacing fossil fuelbased energy sources. Similarly, argue that increased reliance on renewable energy can lead to a considerable reduction in CO2 due to cleaner production processes. However, other studies, such as those by AlNemer et al. , suggest that while renewable energy consumption has a negative impact on emissions, the effect might not be substantial enough in the short to medium term to achieve significant reductions, especially if the overall share of renewable energy in the energy mix remains low. The results in the figure highlight the importance of expanding renewable energy capacity and infrastructure in the United States to ensure sustained long-term reductions in CO2. Figure 7 presents the relationship between FID and CO2 for the United States. We observed that in the short-term (Panel A), the impact of FID on C O2 appears to be generally positive, with higher quantiles showing a stronger positive effect. This suggests that FID, characterized by increased decision-making power and expenditure responsibilities at local levels, is associated with higher emissions in the short-term, especially for regions with higher initial emissions. This may be due to insufficient environmental regulations at local levels to implement effective CO2 reduction measures. In the medium-term (Panel B), the positive effect of FID on CO2 intensifies, particularly at higher quantiles, indicating that the increased autonomy given to local governments may lead to inefficiencies or inconsistencies in environmental policies, thus hindering efforts to reduce emissions. In the long-term (Panel C), the impact remains positive across all quantiles, although it appears slightly weaker compared to the medium-term. This trend implies that, despite potential improvements in fiscal management over time, decentralization without robust coordination may continue to pose challenges for CO2 mitigation. These findings are consistent with the study by and , which suggests that FID can lead to fragmented policies, making it challenging to achieve coordinated climate goals. Fig. 5 Impact of ICT onCO2.

The left-hand side figure shows the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable across all periods Figure 8 presents the impact of FD on C United States. In the short-term (Panel A), the effect of FD on CO2 is consistently negative across all quantiles, implying that an increase in financial development is associated with a decrease in emissions. The effect is slightly stronger at lower quantiles, suggesting that FD can effectively promote ecofriendly projects or cleaner technologies, particularly in regions or sectors with initially lower emissions. In the medium-term (Panel B), the negative impact of FD on C O2 becomes more pronounced across all quantiles. This indicates that FD contributes to enhancing the adoption of sustainable technologies and green financing, which reduces emissions over time. In the long-term (Panel C), the negative interrelationship between FD and CO2 is sustained, although the magnitude of reduction appears slightly smaller compared to the medium-term. This suggests that, in the long run, FD remains a crucial driver for reducing CO2 through the promotion of energy-efficient projects and investments in renewable energy sources. These findings align with the results of studies by Wu et al. , which argue that FD fosters better access to funds for green technologies, thus leading to lower emissions. Similarly, Ofori et al. found that FD plays a significant role in reducing CO2 by enabling green investments. However, these results are in contrast to the findings of Wang et al. , who argued that FD could lead to increased emissions due to the financing of energy-intensive industries. Figure 9 display globalization (GO) on CO2 emissions (CO2). In the short-term (Panel A), the impact of globalization on C O2 is consistently negative across all quantiles, suggesting that increased globalization leads to a reduction in emissions. This indicates that, initially, GO promotes the adoption of cleaner technologies, better practices, and more efficient production methods, especially in regions with low to moderate CO2. The impact is slightly more significant at lower quantiles, implying that GO has a more profound effect on reducing emissions in less polluting sectors. In the medium-term (Panel B), the negative impact becomes stronger, particularly at the higher quantiles, which suggests that GO continues to encourage cleaner production and the sharing of environmentally friendly technologies across more emission-intensive sectors. In the long-term (Panel C), the negative relationship persists, with the magnitude of reduction slightly increasing compared to the mediumterm. This pattern indicates that globalization can effectively contribute to lowering C O2 over a sustained period by promoting cross-border technological innovation and international cooperation on ecological regulations. These findings align with studies, such as those by , which argue that GO helps reduce CO2 through technology diffusion and international cooperation on ecological standards. Similarly, found that GO can lead to better environmental outcomes by fostering efficient resource allocation. On the other hand, the results contrast with those of Rahman and Alam , who argued that GO could potentially increase emissions due to an increase in energy-intensive trade and production activities. Robustness check In this study, for robustness, we compare the coefficients of both Wavelet Quantile Regression (WQR) and Average Wavelet Quantile Regression (AWQQR) models. The blue and red lines represent the WQR and AWQQR coefficients, respectively. Figure 10 compares the slope coefficients from WQR and AWQQR models to evaluate the impact of ICT on CO2 across various quantiles for shortterm (A), medium-term (B), and long-term (C) periods. The result showed positive impact of ICT on C O2 across each quantile and periods. The similar trends between the WQR and AWQQR indicate a consistent effect captured by both models. Figure 11 shows the impact of REC on CO2 emissions across various quantiles for short-term (A), mediumterm (B), and long-term (C) periods. The trends show a significant negative impact of REC on C O2, which suggests a similar trend across all quantiles and periods. This indicates that both models capture a consistent interrelationship, with REC having a generally negative impact on CO2 emissions. Figure 12 presents a comparison between the slope coefficients of two different models, WQR and AWQQR, analyzing the impact of FID on C O2 across different quantiles for short-term (A), medium-term (B), and long-term (C) periods. The result shows that across all quantile distribution of C O2, the impact of FID on CO2 is positive across all quantiles and periods. This suggests that the effect of FID on C O2 is heterogeneous, with different intensities at different levels of the distribution. Figure 13 illustrates the comparison between the slope coefficients of WQR and AWQQR models for analyzing the impact of FD on C O2 across different quantiles and periods. In the short-term (A), medium-term (B), and long-term (C) and across all quantiles, we observed a negative impact of FD on C O2 as shown by the coefficient of both WQR and AWQQR, respectively, showing consistency in trends across quantiles and periods. The similar trends affirm the consistency of the results. Figure 14 compares the slope coefficients of WQR and AWQQR models, analyzing the impact of GO on C across different quantiles for short-term (A), mediumterm (B), and long-term (C) periods. The blue and red lines represent the coefficients of WQR and AWQQR, respectively, showing how GO influence C O2 across various across quantiles and time periods. The similarity in trends between the WQR and AWQQR models suggests that both methods capture a consistent relationship. Fig. 9 Impact of GO onCO2.

Conclusion and policy remarks Conclusion In this study, we pioneer an investigation into the impact of ICT adoption technologies, globalisation, renewable energy consumption, fiscal decentralisation, and financial development on CO2, considering various quantiles and periods. Focusing on the United States, we utilize data spanning from 1990Q1 to 2021Q4. To capture these complex interrelationships, we introduce quantile-based estimators, including wavelet quantileon-quantile regression with p values and quantile cointegration. In addition, wavelet quantile regression and average wavelet quantile-on-quantile regression are employed as robustness checks to ensure the reliability of our findings. The results from the study showed that across all quantiles and periods, ICT adoption technologies and fiscal decentralisation increases CO2, while globalisation, renewable energy consumption and financial development lessen CO2. Findings from the study provide critical insights into achieving the objectives of several SDGs, including SDG 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13. The results suggest that while ICT adoption technologies and fiscal decentralisation may contribute to increase CO2, globalisation, renewable energy consumption, and financial development play a crucial role in mitigating these emissions. Main policy framework in alignment with SDGs In developing a precise policy framework, the current study considers various time periods and economic conditions as detailed below: First, ICT adoption has been shown to increase CO2 across all quantiles and periods, highlighting the need for complementary policies to mitigate its environmental impact, thereby supporting SDG 13. Governments should focus on improving energy efficiency in ICT infrastructure by incentivizing energy-efficient data centres and promoting the use of low-power devices, in Fig. 11 Impact of REC onCO2. The blue and red lines denote the slope coefficient comparing WQR and AWQQR across all periods and quantiles line with SDG 7. In addition, transitioning to renewable energy sources for powering ICT infrastructure will help counteract the increased emissions associated with ICT growth, contributing to both SDG 7 and SDG 13. Policies promoting a circular economy, such as enhancing recycling rates of electronic waste and encouraging manufacturers to adopt eco-friendly production practices, can also help reduce the environmental footprint of ICT in the long term, supporting SDG 12. Second, the negative impact of renewable energy consumption on CO2, particularly in high-emission sectors, underscores the importance of expanding renewable energy capacity and infrastructure across the United States. Policymakers should focus on increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix by making substantial investments in solar, wind, and other sustainable energy sources, in line with SDG 7 and SDG 9. This could be further supported by policies that encourage innovation in renewable technologies and provide financial incentives for households and industries to transition to renewable energy, thereby promoting SDG 9 and SDG 13. In addition, expanding energy storage infrastructure and integrating renewable energy into the national grid will help ensure reliability and efficiency in meeting longterm energy demands. Third, in the short term, globalization has demonstrated a positive impact on emissions reduction, especially in less polluting sectors. Policymakers should leverage this trend by promoting further integration into global markets, particularly in sectors that can adopt cleaner technologies, thus supporting SDG 17. Targeted incentives, such as subsidies or tax breaks for companies embracing international standards for clean production, can accelerate this process. In addition, encouraging cross-border technology transfer through partnerships and trade agreements can amplify the positive effects of globalization on emissions, fostering SDG 9 and SDG 13. Fourth, fiscal decentralization, however, appears to be associated with increased CO2 across all time periods. To counteract this, a coordinated policy approach is required to ensure alignment with SDG 13. Federal and state governments should collaborate to prevent Fig. 12 Impact of FID onCO2. The blue and red lines denote the slope coefficient comparing WQR and AWQQR across all periods and quantiles weakened environmental standards due to local competition for economic growth. This can be achieved by developing a national regulatory framework that mandates minimum environmental performance standards while also providing financial support and capacity-building programs for local governments to effectively enforce these standards, supporting SDG 16. Integrated regional planning and monitoring mechanisms could also play a crucial role in improving local-level accountability and ensuring sustainable development outcomes, in line with SDG 11. Fifth, financial development has a consistently negative impact on C O2, with stronger effects in the medium term. To sustain this trend, governments should channel financial resources towards green investments, particularly in high-emission sectors or regions, supporting SDG 8 and SDG 13. This could involve expanding green finance initiatives, such as providing low-interest loans for renewable energy projects or issuing green bonds to fund public infrastructure that promotes environmental sustainability. The development of green investment funds targeting high-emission industries can also foster significant reductions in C O2, especially when combined with regulatory measures that incentivize banks and financial institutions to prioritize environmentally friendly projects, thus advancing SDG 9 and SDG 13. Tangential policy framework Following the study of Chen et al. , we created a tangential policy framework. While the main policy framework focuses on direct interventions to reduce CO2, the tangential policy framework aims to support these initiatives through broader socio-economic measures. Policymakers should prioritize providing quality education to the public, emphasizing the importance of clean energy and sustainability. Educational curriculum reforms that incorporate knowledge on environmental benefits of clean energy, energy efficiency, and the circular economy Fig. 13 Impact of FD onCO2. The blue and red lines denote the slope coefficient comparing WQR and AWQQR across all periods and quantiles can help ensure that future generations are equipped with the necessary understanding to contribute to these initiatives. Publicprivate partnerships and communitybased awareness programs should also be established to promote environmental awareness and encourage citizen participation in emission reduction activities. By focusing on quality education and awareness, the United States can create a foundation for sustainable development that supports the central policy objectives and aligns with the SDGs. Caveat and future pathways While this investigation employs novel empirical methods and formulate policies aligned with various SDGs, it is not without limitations. First, this study uses C to capture environmental degradation. Although is a common metric in academic research, it does not account for the supply-side aspects of the environment. Future studies should consider alternative metrics, such as ecological footprint and load capacity factor for a more comprehensive evaluation. Second, the policy implications of this study focus primarily on the United States, limiting their generalizability to other nations. Future research should extend the analysis to both developing and developed countries to provide broader insights. Third, the data used in this study ends in 2021 due to the lack of available data for certain variables, such as financial development and fiscal decentralization. Future studies should aim to extend the time frame as new data becomes available. Fourth, significant variables like economic growth, climate policy uncertainty, economic policy uncertainty, and human capital were not included in Fig. 14 Impact of GO onCO2. The blue and red lines denote the slope coefficient comparing WQR and AWQQR across all periods and quantiles the current analysis. Future research should incorporate these factors for a more holistic understanding. Finally, while the methods used in this study are effective, they do not account for the time-varying nature of the relationships explored. Future investigations should consider techniques that address these dynamic aspects.
